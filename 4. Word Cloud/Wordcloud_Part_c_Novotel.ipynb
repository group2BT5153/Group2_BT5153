Die Aussicht beim Frühstück über ganz London und auch die Aussicht aus unserem Zimmer hat uns besonders begeistert. Unser Zimmer war modern und gemütlich eingerichtet; das Bad modern und sauber. \r\n",
      "Das Hotel liegt zwar etwas außerhalb des Zentrums, ist aber mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln schnell und unproblematisch zu erreichen. Zum malerischen Greenwich und dem Museumsschiff \"Cutty Sark\" ist es nur einen Katzensprung mit der U-Bahn.\n",
      "Excellent new hotel. Friendly and helpfull staff. Stunning view from the top floors with bar and restaurant, and also a good view from our room, which was on 19th floor. Breakfast was very nice. The interior/decor at the hotel is a very trendy \"habour style\". Nearby underground (about 5 minutes walk) with a direct line to London Bridge station (change for Gatwick airport), Waterloo station (London Eye) and Bond Street station (Oxford Street). I would love to visit this hotel again, and I highly recommend it.\n",

      "I stay here for work and enjoy it with the breakfast (preferred that they are serving coffee at table rather than self serve at machine which was the case during my prior trip) and when lucky, a room with a view.considerate as said I was with aged parent so provided an accessible room. Shame with the construction next door as walk to the wharf not pleasant.\n",

      "Highly recommended!!\n",
      "Had an amazing view from the restaurant onto central london! Our room did not have a view onto london but was also great. Nicely furnished rooms with perfect space scale — not to much but clearly enough. Breakfast was also a really nice setting. Pool and Gym was good!\n",
      "the location\n",
      "The room was fantastic. Spacious, clean and a good sized TV. The staff were incredibly helpful when it came to advice on things to do in London and were always happy to help with any issues we had throughout our stay. I'd happily recommend it.\n",

      " Everything was perfect\n",
      "The restaurant was outstanding\n",
      "The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly with exception to the chef serving breakfast who was a bit of a grump. Considering what I paid for one night and the fact the hotel boasts 4 stars it would have been nice to have a dressing gown and slippers to visit the pool area in but I was informed this was for deluxe rooms only. Some conditioner in the room would have been nice to accompany the shampoo and accessible water in the pool area along with some more lounge type seating (there were just the two swing seats so no one else knew where to put towels or where to sit if they werent in the pool) would have made it a little more comfortable but all in all a good stay. Views from the restaurant were amazing but advisable to book prior to your stay if you wish to eat in the evening as it was fully booked when we arrived. Breakfast was good but the cooked breakfast could have been a little hotter as it was cold by the time I returned to my seat. If I'm honest I probably wouldnt return as it was missing those little extras but would certainly reccomend it for a short stay. Also worth noting there are a lot of road works and construction in the area which made it difficult to access the DLR.\n",

Weihnachtstag in ganz Canary Wharf. Das tägliche Frühstück im 38.Stock war sehr abwechslungsreich und schmackhaft. Dort ist auch die Hotel-Bar mit netten Drinks und leckeren Snacks. Die Anbindung an öffentliche Verkehrsmittel ist umfangreich (Tube, Bus +DLR) und schnell zu erreichen. Insgesamt ein absolut faires Preis-Leistungsverhältnis - wir würden jederzeit gerne wieder kommen.\r\n",

      "nice view from the room and roof top bar.\n",
      "There was a creaking noise in my room the whole night.We was given a discount for this but this is totally unacceptable and should be in the print when you rent the room saying that if it is windy you won’t get no sleep because of this noise. I went here planning on have a lovely romantic stay with my partner but probably could of stayed indoors with my two kids and had a better nights sleep.\n",

      "The bedroom is lovely and modern with floor to roof windows which had a fantastic view (request a high floor room). The room was cleaned each day and restocked with toiletries etc. The hotel itself is very modern and the staff were helpful with anything we asked as it was our first time visiting London. Perfect place to stay for a city break as close enough to city but far enough away from the main tourist areas which makes it a bit cheaper overall.\n",

Opladen van gsm kan via USB. Er is een strijkijzer en haardroger. Vriendelijke bediening overal, in de bar soms even wachten door drukte. Prachtig uitzicht bij ontbijt/bar op 37e, 38e en 39e. Er zijn hoge tafels met krukjes, maar ook gewone tafels met stoelen.\r\n",
      "Bij aankomst waren onze kamers niet klaar, we kregen een bon waarmee we ondertussen in de prachtige bar iets konden drinken (keuze uit 2 biertjes, wijn of cider), zo zaten we heerlijk op het dakterras in de zon op gezellige loungezetels.\r\n",
      "Midden in het businesscentrum, op een 5 min. te voet van de metro zodat je gemakkelijk en snel in Londen centrum bent. Ook vanaf Londen City Airport vlot te bereiken met metro op een 20 à 30 minuutjes.\r\n",

      "A környezet, a szálloda berendezése, a személyzet segítőkészsége, kedvessége és hatékonysága, a liftek kiválő működése, ami 40 emelet mellett számomra nagy dolog. A szoba és az étterem mesés kilátása Londonra és környékére. A tömegközlekedés közelsége.\n",

      "Despite ultimately spending a lovely New Years with my partner, when we checked into our ‚superior double bedroom suite’, we were underwhelmed to say the least. Compared to other hotels we‘d visited, we didn‘t feel like we‘d discovered a great value for money. We felt the room was small and that there was little to no effort put into the preparation of our room. We didn’t get bath robes, although we saw several people wearing some on the premises (when we asked staff where to find some, nobody knew), no conditioner, no cutlery; and once I addressed this to reception, they really didn’t seem too bothered and brushed it off... On the plus side, the swimming pool and sauna facilities were lovely.\n",

      "Location davvero suggestiva, finemente arredata in stile urban in tutte le zone comuni, a partire dalla reception dove all'arrivo ci si poteva servire da sè un welcome-drink analcolico, fino alla sala colazione situata al 38° piano e al bar serale al 39° che regalano una bellissima vista sul Tamigi e sullo skyline della città e da cui era ben visibile anche lo Shard; l'hotel vanta persino di una terrazza aperta all'ultimo piano corredata da salottini e tavolini, mentre le nostre camere al 21° piano erano dotate di grandi vetrate da cui poter ammirare il paesaggio urbano (che di sera si accende di mille luci), dotate di bagno moderno e doccia spaziosa. Nessun problema neanche con i collegamenti, grazie ai vari mezzi vicini sempre efficienti e facilmente fruibili con la Oyster Card (in questa zona c'è l'overground, a noi piaceva molto perchè almeno si potevano vedere i dintorni durante il viaggio). Soddifatti e felici di essere stati ospiti di questa struttura, ci torneremo al più presto senza alcun dubbio!\n",

De kamers zijn schoon, fijne bedden en voor gezinnen bestaat de mogelijkheid om twee kamers naast elkaar te nemen die een gezamenlijk halletje delen met een \"extra deur\" ervoor. Zo krijg je als het ware één grote kamer voor een gezin. In de omgeving vind je op steenworp afstand verschillende restaurants en natuurlijk het Canary Wharf underground station en een groot ondergronds winkelcentrum. Met de underground ben je slechts 1 halte verwijderd van de O2 Arena en de Emirates Air Line, de kabelbaan over de Thames. Binnen 20-25 minuten ben je voor een paar Euro met de underground in hartje Londen.\n",

      "The staff in both the main hotel and restaurant were rude and dismissive (all apart from one). Our welcome to the hotel felt as if we disturbed the receptionist break as we were quickly checked in with no information on where our room was, where breakfast was held, where any of the facilities are located. Our dinner at the extremely poorly run restaurant was completely ruined by the chef and waiter having a full and animated argument only 2feet from our table. Our order was not taken by the waiter who sat us instead he decided to get someone else. Our plates were left on the table for an extremely long time between courses and staff seemed upset that my partner did not enjoy the main course, at one stage rolling their eyes as they walked away. The shower in our room was not water tight and left a pool of water across the floor after each shower, there was also a brown stain on the carpet which I can only hope was not what I thought it was. Terrible hotel experience would not recommend.\n",
      "Excellent hotel! The breakfast was delicious and restaurant itself was so peaceful, modern and what a view! I am quite a sensory person and love the little touches, so the complimentry chocolates, fragrance in the hotel and fruit juice with ice on the way in were what made me feel relaxed and well looked after. Thank you for a wonderful stay and giving us such a lovely room! We would love to return!\n",

      "Great location and close to the tube. Breakfast inclusion is great value for money. Staff are friendly and super helpful. Close to tesco and other restaurants so you don’t have to rely on the hotels restaurant alone. Canary wharf is a busy hub and has many gems! Late check in can be a bit tricky but midday check out was great! Gym facilities are good but pretty small so timing is important. Great to have access to sauna and pool at no extra cost.\n",

      "The hotel has the height and the hype that goes with the surroundings of Canary Wharf. From it’s contemporary, edgy feel of the interiors, to its grande magnitude in scale and its breathtaking views from the rooms, and rooftop. It really is a spectacular getaway. At night the city lighting up your room glistens beautifully. The bed was well equipped with a lovely mattress topper and feather soft pillows, we stayed on the 28th floor and my word I’d recommend upgrading to a deluxe double, for supreme views, comfort and 24hour room service. Everything about that room was curiosity. Many different buttons and gadgets in built to add subtle charming effects to your experience. Ingenious little things which overall gave such a massive impression on us.\r\n",
      "Breakfast wise, continental breakfast was tastier than your authentic English, but the food tastes that much better when it’s taken in with the spectacular views of the 38th floor. The hotel was exceptionally clean throughout and the staff were lovely, helpful and friendly. The pool is a lot smaller than the photos suggest, but the creativity continue in the pool with buttons that allow you to pour down a mini waterfall feature into the pool, along with a rapids machine. The water was crystal clear and the facilities were fantastic but I would say that more than 6 people in the pool at once would be a crowd - I’d suggest to swim in the evening or the morning to avoid being on top of each other.\r\n",
      "The 39th floor has a rooftop bar and some of the most incredible skylines I have ever seen in London. I like the location, being a 7min walk from the Canary Wharf tube station and a 30min tube to the centre of London is really nice. Means you can get the feeling of escaping and come home to relax.\r\n",
      "I would say that I was expecting a bigger room however, and that you are ultimately paying for one of the best views in London rather than the best rooms in London.\n",

The location is excellent only a short walk from the tube, and many restaurants within a 5 minute walk. The staff were very accommodating, friendly and helpful. The rooftop bar, again, did not disappoint with also an amazing view.\n",

      "Hotel decor in general, bed was very comfy, tele was huge. We were a bit worried at first to find you could see into the shower and through to the toilet from the bedroom. However we quickly located the button for the smart glass which turns the pane of glass from clear to frosted, which I loved. This button wasn't labelled though which I think would be something for the hotel to follow up on. Bar was lovely and welcoming but at £23 a round (two cocktails plus 12.5% service charge) we only stayed for one. That said it is London and we weren't expecting it to be cheap. The hotel also held our bags free of charge for the day after we checked out.\n",

Очень интересные и вкусные блюда Высокой кухни вечером с таким же потрясающим видом, только ночным (цены - ниже средних, как для ресторанов Лондона). Компактный, но очень продуманный и удобный номер. Очень удобная кровать, даже для привередливых людей с проблемной спиной (как у меня). Наличие бассейна и тренажерного зала в отеля, входящих в стоимость номера.\n",

      "I regret having to write this review as I'm usually writing the most amazing reviews about Novotel Canary Wharf. However, our stay this time was quite disappointing to say the least. My partner (Joshim Uddin) booked an Executive Suite for my birthday as this is one of our favorite hotels. The night of our stay we went up to Bokan to get a drink as it was my birthday, I got told the bar shuts at midnight so we went up at 11PM to give us enough time to sit and have one drink. We got approached by a security guard lady (unsure of her name but can give description) She stated to us that the bar was closed, we advised we're staying at the hotel and just come up for one drink as we got told it closed at midnight. She then went over to speak to a lady who then allowed us to buy one drink. However, this whole time we felt very uncomfortable and un-welcomed by the staff / security standing around and staring so we went up to the rooftop, we then got approached by another girl who told us the bar is now closed, we stated we know and we already have our drink. However, she just stood a few feet away from us waiting for us to leave, so in the end we just took our drinks back to our room! This had ruined our night completely and we were and still are angry at how we got treated! We were very gutted as we were debating on staying an extra night with you guys but after the first night we just knew it wouldn't make us happy. The day of check out, we left our luggage at the hotel and came back to get them around 9PM, we decided to relax in the members lounge area for an hour before we headed home, once again I got approached by a security guard this time a male. He came over and said \"are you a member?\" I said \"yes I'm a member of the accor hotels\" he then replied \"are you staying at the hotel tonight\" I stated that we checked out that morning and we're getting our luggage, we were just relaxing before we head home.\n",
      "This hotel is not suitable for children at all(specially the swimming pool ) , the “executive lunch” (for suite’s rooms)is not exist there is a place with coffee machine (which was broken ) the soft drinks are looked on the fridge and nothing more! Bathroom utensils were missing (no hair conditioner and shower gel ) also shampoo, body lotion and towels were missing when we arrived .\n",

The bed was comfortable and the room was spacious, not to mention the big TV flat screen we had! \r\n",
      "The service was lovely, we ordered some room service and it was served with a smile, very friendly and approachable staff. I will be booking here again for definite.

      "After checking in, we went up to our room on the 17th floor (1706). WOW x2! The room was spotlessly clean, and was honestly better than I could have ever hoped. The highlight was probably the amazing view of the city skyline. Seeing London at sunset, lit up at night and waking up to it in the morning was incredible.\r\n",
      "Upon exploring the room, we came across a birthday card and caramel chocolate left for my boyfriend - such a nice touch.

Der Putz über der Dusche bröckelt ab und fliegt beim duschen einen auf den Kopf. Unsauber. Etliche Haare und Wasserflecken in der Glasdusche.

When we complained to the duty manager he admitted they regularly get complaints and it’s “because of the wind”. Yes I know, crazy right?

      "The Reception staff was extremely rude and arrogant - when telling him this he made sure we had worst room in hotel 1105 - aircon not working Shower taking 10 min to warm bright lights from working site outside. His name was Danilo he really spoilt our stay.\n",

      "We were given a disabled room, which was fine as it was quite spacious etc, but my bed felt like it was lopsided I think it was probably due a new mattress? If I was staying for more than a night then I would have asked to change rooms, but everything else was good so couldn't really complain. The only other thing we found was that the drinks were very pricey compared to neighbouring hotels and restaurants.\n",

      "Asked for twins bed but when I got to the room it was a double. That said, it was swiftly fixed.\n",
      "No hot water on day of departure. Not being able to have a warm shower, shave, shampoo, was a real let down. Location is a 15min walk from the centre of Canary Wharf activities and transport links (underground and DLR); ok for me, perhaps not so for the less fit or mobile.\n",

      " The bar staff We were told to move around the bar various times as they were unable to accommodate for paying guests due to reservations despite me phoning up beforehand to ensure we had a table and was told you can just simply walk in and get a table The bar staff was extremely slow and took 30 minutes to make us a cocktail and when asked if he could mix our favourite cocktail he simply refused abruptly and demanded us to choose strictly from the menu or he won t be making a drink \n",

      "We also had to wait a long time to be seated at breakfast (and had a large queue behind us) although there were many empty tables. Again we were told at 10:40 that the buffet was closing shortly and to head to the buffet table if we wanted more. I was disappointed with the cleanliness at breakfast - I don't think it had been cleaned from the night before but also dirty glasses and crockery were stacking up because again they looked understaffed.\r\n",
      "The bedding in our room looked a little basic. More what you would expect at home rather than at a hotel.\n",
      "Check in was awkward in view of the fact they demanded ID for our 16 year old. As UK citizens we don't normally carry this so this came as a surprise. It would have been good to been informed of this.\n",
      "The rooms are not sound proof so you can hear the people banging and playing music and shouting from the room above us. You can also hear the showers being used, and also the toilet when flushed, not pleasant at all.\r\n",
      "Also we left our room at 12.00 and return at 4.30 our room was still not cleaned, bed not made, although I had made it myself, and the cleaner came at 5.30 to clean the room, unbelievable, we were relaxing and told her to leave it.\n",
      "On one of the days the breakfast was cold.\n",
      "Lifts were slow\n",

      " On the arrival the check in was a mess and the service atmosphere was monotone and like a dull machine There were no bath towels in the room The breakfast was served on the 37th floor and again the view was amazing But nobody gave me any notice and it was difficult to know whether I shoud just take a seat or wait someone to show me to the table When I was finally shown to the table nobody was interested to take my order for coffee The next morning I ordered breakfast from the room service A few items from my order was missing The service concept is not ready at this hotel and I will not return \n",
      "The only thing they can improve on is maybe bathroom products. There was literally shampoo and shower gel, that’s it - so no body lotion or conditioner.\n",

      "I did want to reserve a few other additional services for my partner's birthday but unfortunately had to fill out a paper form with all my details and scan - not very safe so I declined. Also was told there was no need to book a table in the bar, but there were lots of tables reserved and we weren't able to get one. \r\n",
      "The price of the breakfasts, and particularly room service is extortionate! \r\n",

      "I like everything about it.\n",
      "I didn’t like the fact the shower room was so close to bed and only had half a glass door as a lot of water got out. I also didn’t like that there was a hole in the bathroom wall & we had some electrical equipment in our room that didn’t work, also the telly was in an awkward position.\n",
      "Bed was very uncomfortable, and the smell made me check out early.\n",
      "Only poor thing is that you cannot let in fresh air into your room. Smells quite musty inside the room. We had a room for disabled people which was allright, but the tap was really annoying because you were only able to turn on the water when you fully turned it on which means that the water spilled everywhere. That was really stupid.\n",
      "Was very hot\n",
      " Sauna was not working Not information given about hotel much Food horrible I don t recommend anyone stay at this hotel I am so disappointed \n",
      "I didn't like the absolute absence of gluten-free food at the café downstairs and also on the restaurant upstairs, during breakfast. Unfortunately, I was very sad for that.\n",

      "The stay wasn't longer!\n",
      "No Bath tub\n",

      "Pool very small. Staff on second day very poor and the breakfast had to wait 20 minutes to get a table. \r\n",
      "Also had offer for a pizza and a drink £16 and when phoned to get it they said that restaurant is closed and you can order same thing of room service menu but it was £26 or something like that. We ended up phoning Pizza Hut and getting a deliver for cheaper.\n",
      "That there wasn’t a door to toilet. And no real doors to bathroom.\n",
      " The staff in the evening almost ruined the surprise proposal\n",
      "The pool was out of order 12-3pm which is unusual as we wanted to go during that time. Would be more suitable to clean in the AM when no one is using it.\n",
      "Room was right next to the lift so a bit noisy. The restaurant and bar are very “cool” so might not be to everyone’s taste!\n",
      "Reception staff didn't explain to us the complimentary mini bar selection and what time we could check out.\r\n",
      "The heating in our room didn't work properly, had to wait for someone to come & then informed that someone else will come in 30 mins which they didn't.\n",
      "No Parking. Poor staff attitude, towels all over the floor and no clean towels in changing rooms. No fraught beer available. Expensive bar. Brittannia across the toad has parking, cheap drinks and friendly staff.\n",

      "The wind was rattled the window. But wasn’t a major issue.\n",
      "My husband was joining us for breakfast but decided against it as an additional breakfast was at a cost of £25.00. Far too expensive. Anyone would struggle to consume £25.00 worth of breakfast.\n",
      "Value for money, cleaningless and airconditioning\n",
      " You could see into the toilet from the room as it was glass see through so my partner was watching my poo from the bed very awkward hopefully not all rooms are designed like that \n",
      "The car park was far from the hotel.\n",
      "Not Applicable. I liked everything.\n",
      "My room was several categories lower than I booked. I booked a room with floor windows but instead I had tiny windows. The room was very cold. It took a night to heat the room to a habitable temperature.\n",
      "The breakfast was a little over priced but lovely.\n",
      "Reception staff to look smarter\n",
      "Our sink was clogged the whole time. Also maid service didn’t replenish tea each day which I would expect in London. The are minor. But could be improved. Also there wasn’t a mirror to see in when you blow dry your hair. We had to plug in on a wall outside the bathroom, which was fine, but there wasn’t a mirror to use.\n",
      "Shower doors are not in good shape and the bathroom is getting flooded every time\n",
      "Nothing everything was brilliant will be back again and again\n",
      "Firstly when checking in we was rushed through check in to be told our room wasn’t ready anyway. We finally got to our room that night & realised the lamp next to the bed was broken so we had to have the lights on that were next to the pillows. When waking up in the morning to start the day off with a coffee we found out that the kettle was broken. I called front desk to tell them could they fix it and they said “we will send someone up”....... 30 minutes later after patiently waiting I then called again to ask what was the hold up & the reply was “ohhh have they not been yet, I will call the team to find out what the hold up is” we then again waited another 5 minutes still no knock on the door. Frustrated with the hold up I called again & had to actually ask if it was possible to get 2 coffees? Not even an offer from staff it’s like they didn’t even care (still no maintenance team on hand) finally the coffee arrived after a 45 minutes and it was literally the size of a shot of espresso (latte was requested) really wasn’t worth it. Just to top it all off I’ve arrived home today & checked my bank account for payments made & they have taken £150 out. I pre paid for the room back in April to get it cheaper then to see £150 taken out for “pre authorisation” which we didn’t know about or get told about before agreeing at check in. I had to find this out by calling the hotel to then yet again wait for a hour to get a email for reasons why and they said apparently it was only meant to be £100 & the extra £50 was “a glitch in the system” so now I have to wait 3-5 days for a refund. No phone call back to apologies just a email for me to go off & wait for my refund. Utterly shocking service for what I thought was a respectable hotel chain. I won’t be using any Accor hotels again!!\n",

I rung reception and complained at 2:30 am when complaining at check out they asked if I had kept ringing and complaining through the night ? I was trying to sleep and my partner had to work early in the morning !!! All they offered me was a 2x drinks voucher for their cafe!! Also room service is very very overpriced and not very nice we paid £63 for 2x breakfast which was cold once again they wasn’t interested in my complaints\n",

      "For an expensive stay rate ; no breakfast included, full English £25 pp - how can you justify that; no teaspoons to stir coffee, only two English breakfast teabags, enough milk for one cup, view of buildings ugly (not relaxing at all)... there are better night rates with breakfast included and nicer venues in London. First few times I stayed attention to detail and inclusive rates were better... or was it just an unfortunate visit?\n",

I thought it was just us but saw other customers faces drop when they got hit with the charge when checking in. Got told would get the money back in few days after checking out.\r\n",
      "Discretionary service charges are automaticly added so not discretionary. Got hit with them when ordering drinks even thoug I was at the bar. Got hit when we ordered a pizza (from cafe on ground floor), no came to our table and served us, all four of us walked up to till put our orders on. Maybe it's London thing and us Northerners expect to see a bit more service before getting charged for the most basic of service.\n",

      "The lack of instructions for screening the shower and toilet - not something within our experience! We got there half way through the stay and just found it very funny!\n",
      " As fantastic as the staff were there wasn t enough of them to make the service 10 10 I d say at best the service purely due to lack of staff was 3 10 and all our party said the same On talking to others in the bar it was the only negative Not one guest looked happy with wait times on drinks and food but they never actually stopped for a minute In fact one waiter was there at breakfast after we left him at 1 40am the night before It s a real shame there wasn t more staff around as the ones that were left a fantastic impression on us and would prompt a return visit \n",
      "Noise from plumbing / air conditioning like a high pitched Hoover was constant all night which made restful sleep Impossible.\n",
      " No car parking\n",
      "All around the hotel were building-sites. Made it a bit hatd to find your way, the shortest way to your destination. The staff was helpful and described the best way to the tube.\r\n",
      "When we wanted to visit the skybar the lady at the entrance didn't treat us welcoming. She didn't believe we were hotelguests and made us show our roomcard. Just the next day we found out we showed up after closing time. If she would have let us know from the beginning, we would have understood and would have come back another night. Comunication is key.\n",
      "The man at reception told us that the breakfast was £5 which we was happy with. The next day £50 had been taken out of our account and when we called to see why they told us that the breakfast was £25 each (I had some egg, 2 sausages and a coffee) which I don’t think is worth £25\n",
      "A small mix up by one of the female reception staff who told us we couldn’t have late check out and told us we had to vacate our room when we had been advised the night before that we could request it any time up to 12. And this made the end of our stay a little fraught but Jerome sorted this for us with such professionalism. And staying until 4pm made the World of difference to us.\n",
      "When we went to use the spa facilities, there was no sauna :( but other than that everything was great!\n",
      "Literally nothing - it was incredible\n",
      "No milk with the complimentary tea & coffee facilities. Would have preferred larger bath towels. It would have been helpful & caused less panic if we had been informed of the fire alarm testing when we checked in.\n",
      "Wait time for breakfast\n",
      "Smelly Bathroom in Room 3108 Overall I stayed here twice and it was not disappointing.\n",
      "Nothing to not like\n",
      "Broken kettle in room\n",
      "The only issue we had was not being informed beforehand that we would need identification for my child though it was thankfully easily resolved by a person back home emailing me the identification documents.\n",
      "We liked everything.\n",
      "Service slightly slow with breakfast as there was no menu in our room\n",
      "Small lobby\n",
      "The fact we had NO hot water, and it took 50 minutes to fix, which then made us over an hour late, the staff were not very understanding, didn’t really seem to care that we had plans, the house keeping kept knocking at our door at 09:45 when check out wasn’t until 12 noon and carried on knocking until we answered. Then the fire alarm went off 3 times at 11am and had no good gesture of compensation.\n",
      "Check-in was a bit long, stuff asked me to wait like 15min while they checking my room, but no one told me once it has been done, so I probably waited longer than I should and had to come back myself to ask again. Also, I haven't been told about the facilities, opening times etc.. No information at all and this is a second time at this hotel when I receive no information at check-in. You should tell your stuff on reception to give more information to the guests.\r\n",
      "Also, the lifts aren't working well. Most of the times we had to wait like 5min to get downstairs, although there are about 6 lifts. Also, when we wanted to go from 38th floor (where the bar is) to our room (27th floor), we took last lift (the one on the far right) and in that lift we could not get anywhere apart from the ground floor, because that lift seems like is built for external restaurant visitors only. On the ground floor that lift doors open on the other side, so you can only go outside the hotel, not a reception, so that was really confusing and we had to go outside and come in via the main entrance. You should put a title above that lift to inform guests who are staying in hotel to not use it.\n",
      "I dont like the reception I came here twice they were nice before but now there a bit more aggresive.\r\n",
      "Before they were nice women and now there are men.\n",
      "They serve pancakes with honey...where's the butter and maple syrup??\n",
      "They wrote us a card which was lovely but it was only our 5th anniversary and the card said ‘happy 20th anniversary’ \r\n",
      "Not a problem obviously, made us laugh.\n",
      "The staff, especially the supervisor “INES” I’ve never ever received such bad service from anyone in my life like I did with this lady. She was very abrupt, dismissive & had a lot of attitude which you wouldn’t expect from a supervisor. Whereas “Verno or Verca” not sure what his name was sooo understanding, welcoming & polite. He really was ready to help & assist.\r\n",
      "The story behind my feedback is, it was my birthday, so in advance I contacted hotel directly over the phone & asked if it will be possible to get an early check in. Now normally people are asking for upgrades, beautiful view etc. However for myself, it was different. The man over the phone said that it will be fine & that I should come at 1pm instead of 3pm.\r\n",
      "But he did mention to call that same morning to confirm it was still okay.\r\n",
      "Now I did exactly that, I called 10am on the day & he was same person I spoke to prior who now confirmed it was still okay to come at 1pm.\r\n",
      "Now I got there at 2pm & I’m was now being told that it’s not possible. And that they’ll work on something. Which I was fine with, however what I was disappointed with, was the fact that the booking doesn’t state that I need to make a deposit on top of payment of my room upon arrival.\r\n",
      "Anyway, I was willing to pay but I explained to both Ines & gentleman that that it’s not in booking & they agreed booking.com don’t say it but it’s their rule and I made them aware of how misleading it was & they agreed.\r\n",
      "Anyway, moving forward I ask to pay by cash for deposit even though I managed to pay with my card for room but that was due to sufficient on the card. “Verna or Verco” can’t remember his name, said that was fine he went to get document I needed to sign then all I hear is Ines shouting walking out saying “no no no noooo!! We don’t take cash & Verna/Verco asking why? It’s fine. She paid with card for room, we can take cash. And Ines shouting no, cash! Card only!\n",
      " This isn t a criticism on you are your hotel But I didn t like the frosted see through glass shower panel my better half uses the toilet a lot during the night and the whole bedroom light up when she put the bathroom light on it didn t matter if it was frosted or not This won t prevent me from staying here again but I ll leave the wife home next time \n",
      "Long queues to check-in, long queues for the lifts, queues for breakfast and insufficient staff, plates, cups.....no milk in the room for a coffee and reception refused to provide any when asked\n",
      "I struggled to find the light to the bathroom. However I was a bit drunk on the lovely cocktails from the roof bar :-)\n",
      "We didn’t have our coffee replenished\n",
      "Breakfast wasn't of the standard I expected, and service was a little lack lustre.\n",
      "I thought the food and drink in the restaurant was very expenses\n",
      " twice the staff tried to come into the room whilst we were in and on the saturday morning there was a leak in the bathroom maintenance were very good but spoilt our plan for a lie in lol\n",
      "The price of breakfast was extremely expensive and we had to find somewhere else to go\n",
      " booked specifically for the roof bar and was told no need to book then told we couldn t go there as we hadn t booked other bar was far to hot with no air con and every seat reserved so had to go elsewhere for drinks\n",
      "Staff are rude & don't communicate properly, pool & gym are small, rooms do not have any extra amenities, shower cap, hand soap ect\n",
      "Nothing,we loved the hotel!\n",
      "Nothing. The only thing I didn’t like about the stay was the breakfast. Sausages and eggs were not tasty and a little strange!\n",

      "S\n",
      "Due COVID-19 few facilities were close.\n",
      "My room wasn’t what I have expected, the room wasn’t clean (a sanitary napkin at the wall ? ) .... and nobody takes care about it, I only received an sorry.\n",
      "Room service - 2 x bottles of water £12!!!\n",
      "Booked and paid with a card which had since been replaced so had to give a new card and pay again. Yet to see refund to original but new payment has been taken, hoping this is just a bank slow issue\n",
      " The breakfast the staff were not attentive when items ran out and the seats were not comfortable as it was part of the bar area\n",
      "The room - very basic and small, the beds (twin) were small and we were charged £90 for the privilege of moving from a double to a twin.\n",
      "Stains in carpet\n",
      "Strange that there are duvets under the sheets to lie on. Bar very expensive with service on everything! Definitely aim at the business market.\n",

      "The bathroom had an nasty smell every night. Had to make sure the door was completely closed\n",
      "could we have more sugar in the room next time lol. Im joking i have no complains😂.\n",
      "Well, considering it's covid I understand that staff have their own rules to follow and made new restrictions in giving assistance. One of the changes was they do not do room service so we had to stack used towels and floor mats somewhere for 2 nights and the bins both in the bathroom and outside were full up so it was quite a mess. \r\n",
      "We requested to have a room service as we had dinner outside but I was told it wasn't possible due to covid restrictions which didn't quite make sense to me since they would have cleaned the room when we check out regardless.\r\n",
      "I understand that the pandemic made it extra difficult to fulfill these things but I really believe something needs to be done in this area of concern one way or another as it ends up smelling and looking unpleasant which can be uncomfortable for guests.\n",
      " sauna not working\n",
      "The wind rattled the window a little. But wasn’t a major issue.\n",
      "Pool facilities are nothing like photos advertised\n",
      "There were no teaspoons in the room so if you needed to have tea or coffee you couldn't stir it. The cooked breakfast was not very warm and the bacon I found was very overdone.\n",
      "The beds could be softer they have mattress toppers but it still seems very hard\n",
      " Room a little small\n",
      "The room we booked was given to someone else!\r\n",
      "I was given a disabled room with smelly mouldy bathrrom. When asked for another room was told they r fully booked and gave me an attitude that is very poor. This is not what you’d expect from a 4 star hotel!\r\n",
      "The manager was lovely and handled our complaint decent. But the staff at the reception needs to learn some manners!\n",
      "I had to call housekeeping for amenities, they didn't speak english so difficult to communicate. the light from the refrigerator stayed on all night. the hotel is far from city center. the coffee.\n",

      "I added an extra day to the reservation via phone call but the payment didn't go through and I wasn't notified about this... I had to deal witht the issue on site when I arrived. Luckily it was resolved to the same room but it was only by chance.. since they could have given the room away.\n",
      "Waiting for the lift !\n",
      "Front of house team need some training they are not welcoming , grumpy as hell , not helpful . Seeing thier faces like you have to turn a mill away from them . No door in between toilet and bathroom . Pool board need level . Floor was slippery In Bathroom , found dirty pillows. Hair on the bed on the sofa , sofa was full of stains and stinked , no face towels . At last you do not want to know what was under the bed ( food , dust , bread crumps . Etc )\n",

      "Manager at bar was lovely to customers but gave out to the staff a lot in front of customers. Felt a little sorry for them\n",
      "What a lovely and modern hotel. The views are excellent from the roof top. The vast array of breakfast catered for everyones needs.The Friendly staff were accommodating.The pieasta resistance was a glass wall joining the bedroom and bathroom together. With a touch of a button, the glass wall became frosted. My partner was very happy..\n",
      "For the cost of the hotel, I was expecting more. I have to call the reception for water as the amount in room is very little. There were no slippers or vanity set. I have to ask for all of these items. If it was a second star hotel then that was ok but I paid nearly 300 GBP for 1 night then I would expect a better service.\n",
      "Too far from downtown but an easy walk to the station and a short ride to wherever you needed to go. Also the staff wasn’t the most friendly, maybe they were just a bit short in their delivery of info.\n",
      "They seem to be short of towels and bathrobes. AC does not leave the auto mode. Had to turn it off. Not much space to hang anything in the bathroom, pillows not comfortable. The rain shower was dripping cold water when using the other shower head. The area is not the best for pubs and restaurants.\n",
      "Nothing:)\n",
      "We arrived in the morning and were told the room is ready but £30 extra for an early check in which we didn’t do it. So we went out and came back at night around 11pm. Checked in and when I went to use the bathroom noticed that there were a clump of hair on the towel. There were also blood stain and body hair on the bed too. I immediately called the housekeeping and the woman on the phone seemed doesn’t understand me. I waited for 15mins no one came up so I had to call the reception asking for the person who was in charge. I then got speak to this gentleman. After I showed him the hair he explained that the hair on the towel was unacceptable that they will definitely investigate however the hair on the bed looks like the hair from someone’s arm. He asked me what he could do for me and I asked for another room which he told me “the hotel was full” without even checking or thinking. He did offer me new towel and asked if I need the bed sheet changed but at 11:30pm I just couldn’t wait any longer after spending all day out!!\n",

      "Reception getting me in a flap because I had mislaid my credit card at check in. I was made to open out my whole suitcase to look for it in front of other customers. Also, substantial construction and road works right next to the hotel meant getting a taxi was a nightmare.\n",

      "The mains power to our room also went off twice causing us to ring reception and wait for someone to come and flip it back on (which they did promptly)- I’m assuming this was a temporary problem though!\n",
      "Location could be better, but who’s complaining.\n",
      "There was only one coffee machine in the breakfast area by the bar which could have been maintained better , water leaking onto the area surrounding it and on the floor. Perhaps a further machine would have been an idea\n",
      "Breakfast staff was very grumpy\n",
      "Overall there were no issues however, the fragrance at the front desk is very overpowering. I’m not certain why it’s needed 😬\n",
      "The tv requires a hdmi cord which we asked for at reception but they never got back to us.\n",
      "A little bit expensive drinks and £25 pp breakfast but I think most of the guests staying will not even think about that, it is nice but for a Yorkshire lad who’s used to a full English for under a tenner, it did seem steep.\n",
      "We only had shampoo and soap by way of toiletries, for such a lovely hotel I expected more( conditioner/shower gel/ lotion/vanity kit)\r\n",
      "The shower in the spa is in the disabled toilet, only body wash available!!\n",
      "Something missing \r\n",
      "Like green tea . Bath has shampoo only . Should be body lotion and soap etc . Sleeper\n",
      "This is a fantastic modern trendy hotel with views to die for of London.\r\n",
      "We were upgraded to an executive room at arrival on the 31st floor which was clean with 1st rate facilities. \r\n",
      "Bokan 39 probably has the best roof top tarrace in Canary Wharf.. 100% recommended.\n",
      " More staff\n",
      "Only thing I didn't like was how expensive the food and drink was in the resteraunt Other than that was great and views superb\n",
      "Room and bit small for price charged\n",
      "Allocated an accessible room and had to be asked to be moved. \r\n",
      "Bit pricing for the quality of the room and the location from the city centre\n",
      "Danilo was a bit of a dick when dealing with an issue regarding my 17-year-old girlfriend's check-in, this could've been avoided if they sent an email requesting permission prior to check-in. The view from the room was especially underwhelming since the window was too small, there was no toilet brush to deal with 'skids'.\n",
      "Liked everything!\n",
      "Very expensive for the dinner.\n",
      "We were woken up by noise from above our room, no fault of the hotel.\n",
      "Location a bit off centred if you just come for sightseeing. You can hear the train(TFL) running in the early morning.\n",
      "One of the reception staff members were quite rude and blunt\n",
      "No milk for tea/coffee supplied\r\n",
      "Whats app service promoted on the TV but my messages were ignored\r\n",
      "Few toiletries, not even enough for both of us\r\n",

      "No tables available for evening meal - we should have pre-booked but we didn't think we would need to.\n",
      "Most staff were friendly except one who was asked to replenish the snacks and he seemed grumpy about it.\n",
      " we ordered room service and the food was cold and not that great \n",
      "I ordered two balloons through the guest amenities brochure, these were quite expensive at £9 each and were unfortunately not attached to the ribbon properly resulting in one flying away as we left the hotel which was upsetting for my partner. It should be made sure that balloons are done properly, there is a hole in the tag of each of for the ribbon and this needs to be used.\n",
      "I didnt like that my toilet leaked and the bathroom smelt musty.Also the shower leaked and the floor was never dry.\n",
      "Inthought Breakfast in hotel was v.expensive at £28 pp.\n",
      "The room for an executive suite was very small and it did say there is a private bathroom but it was only a shower.\n",
      "Breakfast was rather expensive but was worth it for the view.\n",
      "When we informed them that the mini fridge hadn't been restocked properly, they didn't do anything about it. Probably thought we were trying it on! And the double bed we were meant to have was just 2 singles put together with a thin and uncomfortable mattress topper.\n",
      "The fridge kept flashing a bright white light which light up the room all night because it was broken.\n",
      "The first room we spent our first night In had a leak in the toilet and a blocked sink - which wasn’t nice to look at and the tv didn’t work - making it uncomfortable for my partner to sleep\n",
      " Gym should be free\n",
      "1) the building is so cheap that it shakes and creaks in the wind. We didn’t sleep at all because it was so noisy - even with ear plugs! Apparently this is a fundamental problem with the cheap building construction and the wind affects all floors (We were on the 5th floor). We asked other guests at breakfast and everyone had the same complaint. The building quality is too cheap and not fit for purpose. V disappointing\r\n",
      "2) hotel breakfast was standard 3 star quality. It was fine but nothing special\r\n",
      "3) no bath in the room and the “extra large bed” in the studio suite was just a normal sized bed. Nothing special\r\n",
      "4) smart TV only works with android phones. Not compatible with firestick or chromecast \r\n",
      "I won’t be visiting again. I rate it as a basic 3 star hotel.\n",
      " Glass wall between bathroom and bedroom \n",
      "Nothing much tbh\n",

      "Nothing really\n",
      "No parking at hotel.\n",
      "Breakfast - not great value for money, buffet food was cold, bland and tasteless. There is however a good variety of food available, as well as hot food fruit, cold meats, yoghurt, cereals etc.\n",
      "the bathroom for such hotel like this with the exclusive room i took could have been away better!\r\n",
      "hotel stuff could have been less cheapskates and spoil more at the room with wine and the minibar\n",
      " everything was perfect however maybe a couple of more shortbread biscuits\n",
      "Nothing. Great hotel, great location, very friendly staff.\n",
      " Noise in the evening as theoutside cooled after day in the sun\n",
      "Room708 - Bed mattress topper and bottom sheet coming loose when sleeping, messy. Curtains not on the rail correctly. Door at bar fridge hanging skew on hinges. Guide to operating TV not in room and both TV's coming on at the same time then changing to different channels. Staff just not that helpful and sometimes rude.\n",
      "That my preference was overlooked and my request was not considered and no one prepared to make amends for the errors. Also they were not prepared to accept a deposit in cash\n",
      " Valet parking \n",
      "Not a thing.\n",
      "I asked for some special amendments to be done as the stay was for a special occasion. Instead I was given chocolate and wasn’t called by the hotel to see what special arrangements could be made. My key card didn’t work for the swimming pool and fitness centre.\n",
      "Bigger and springier bed!\n",
      "Location is not that great\n",
      "Guest service managers’s attitude was simply appalling. Quick to offer extras and take payment but no organisation of delivery of products led to surprise being ruined and on top of that she appeared at the door huffing and puffing. Passive aggressive, dismissive, sharp and rude. Absolutely disgraceful behaviour and completely ruined a stay that had potential to be very memorable.\n",
      "View from the room was disappointing - 15th floor- not worth the money i paid. We had a really good view last time and so was expecting good things again but we were let down\r\n",
      "I asked for chips for room service at 2am and the gentleman refused to serve them alone without the Bokan burger even though i dont eat meat so couldnt get the burger. Ive had chips before at that time at Novotel as they can arrange this but he refused this time as he said they dont do that- it was just chips!\n",
      "Nothing at all was below our expectations, we only stayed one night however.\n",
      "Gym, I wish they had more equipment e.g. free weights.\n",
      "Everything was perfect.\n",
      "There wasn’t anything not to like.\n",
      "Stained carpet in room. No disposable slippers so bare feet on (smelly) carpet walked on by previous guests. Yuk. Stains on \"clean\" towels. Dirty cups on tray in room. No shower cap. No dressing gown. Loo seat up with other evidence it had been used by an unknown man. No extra blanket in room (which was chilly despite turning heating up to 23. ) Worst of all probably was the disgusting smell of sewage emanating from the plug holes in the bathroom area. Housekeeping generally left a lot to be desired.\n",
      "Some building working going on in the area which meant having to walk done a dark lonely alley at night coming from the tube station which felt a bit dodgy but doesn't take away from the great experience in the hotel itself.\n",
      "Not enough hooks in the bathroom to dry towels\n",
      "House keeping didn’t turn up till late afternoon, the room wasn’t really cleaned, sheets wasn’t changed and there were holes in the sheets and the curtains.\n",
      "Can’t really fault the hotel or guest services on anything so not applicable on this occasion.\n",
      "Waiting time getting a drink in the bar was just awful. Left and went to a bar in Canary Wharf in the end. Needs improving.\n",
      "The way the wind would effect the building. It was windy all night, which was creating a creeking noise which was unsettling, and disturbed my sleep. Myself and many other customers complained.\n",
      "Nothing, everything was perfect.\n",
      "No mirror for hair and make-up in natural light, no plug point anywhere near long wardrobe mirror. Ridiculous shelf in shower, it was a twin room but only one comfy chair. what’s with the nasty plastic pencil and two sheets of paper?\n",
      "The male at the desk was a little rude to others on the phone when we were waiting to be given our room\n",
      "The lights in the room could not be switched individually\n",
      " nothing\n",
      "Nothing as such.\n",
      "The soundproofing in the rooms aren’t that great I could hear other guests above my head through the ceiling walking and conversing. It also seemed the celling structure was weak as I could also hear the impact of their footsteps which would lead you to believe the felling could collapse at anytime. I don’t believe I was refunded my deposit of fifty pounds either .\n",
      "Breakfast is too expensive (£25!)\n",
      "I couldn’t see many staff around breakfast, on room service menu we could choose from poached, fried or scrambled egg however, the next day when we went up for breakfast there was only scrambled and the staff/waitress was nowhere to be seen. The pool area is lovely. I would give this hotel 10/10 if they had a jacuzzi or steam room!\n",
      "Covid had an impact eg no mini bar in room (but free drink instead). Issue with the room initially but quickly sorted (twin not double as booked) and final billing incorrect but again, resolved effectively.\n",
      "I didn’t like about the hotel was that even thought it says breakfast is till 11am if you come in at 10.15 they say they are cleaning everything up in 10 minutes you feel very rushed and it was a little bit annoying having them tidy things up around you and take things off your table when you were still eating. Also I know it is a la Carte but the restaurant menu wasn’t very varied it didn’t have much for people who only eat chicken or are vegetarian, so we had to leave and go up to the bar for food instead. They are only very minor dislikes as everything else about the hotel I loved.\n",
      "No taxi service\n",
      "Having to pay £30 for dressing gown hire.\n",
      "A bit far from the canary wharf underground station\n",
      "Not a bad word to say about it\n",
      "No on site parking but not an issue as cheap local parking was available.\n",
      "12.5 % surcharge on all purchases in bar\n",
      "Cleaning staff was very inefficient. Didn’t come to clean for two days, had to call and ask for cleaning. Then kept opening the door without knocking at all (this happened several times), no apology and ignored me when I asked what was going on.\n",
      "You can only connect Android phones to the TV.\n",
      "No conditioner for hair\n",
      "The hotel was perfect, only thing I disliked and thought was rude, was the fact the a 12.5% discretion tip was added to every bill - to me a tip is up to myself, not meant to feel compulsory. - this is a general annoyance I experienced.\n",
      " We booked restaurant at 8 00 pm and it was delayed till 8 30 pm\n",
      "I don’t think there is anything I could say I didn’t like , was looking forward to the steam room , but the spa didn’t have one , and also thought breakfast would be included with the stay .\n",
      "The English breakfast wasn't the best but it was okay. The first day we order it had more quantity and the next day less. Swimming pool and gym was too small. One staff in Bokan was rude by kicking us out of the bar area. Apart from that it's a really nice hotel\n",
      "Just a little bit far away from the tourist points, but the underground is very closed. It’s still worth to stay here, it’s very comfort. I will be back.\n",
      "Room was not hoovered upon arrival nor the day after despite letting the front desk know. On the third day the room was not cleaned at all and when brought to the attention of staff they offered free drinks at the bar or room service but this should not have been happening in the first place. Nobody to help with luggage even though I was alone with 2 suitcases and 2 bags. Overall, it was disappointing and not worth the money. Could easily find another hotel for the same price with better services, facilities and location.\n",
      "More keycard issues, relatively few lifts for the number of floors and rooms. Whilst the reception staff are lovely and friendly, service at the bar is very slow.\n",
      "It was my partner's birthday celebration and I agreed with someone to get a package booked. This was not arranged on arrival and ruined the day. Staff done nothing to arrange a solution\n",
      "Slow service at restaurant\n",
      "there was nothing we didn't like\n",
      "The staffs approach and the fact that receptionist tell lies and think you're an idiot\n",
      "Only really fault I could have is no parking but hey ho it is London.\r\n",
      "And the lifts, they were very slow and would end up waiting a long time for a lift eventually get to you. But who’s in a rush.\n",
      "Weren't given robes in our room which was a little disappointing. We asked for some and were told they weren't included in our room rate, i personally think they should be included in all room rates. Not much seating around the pool but pool, sauna and gym were lovely none the less.\n",
      "Construction outside our bedroom window\n",
      "I’ll probably say the mattress. It was too hard for me and my partners backs. Also the shower door as it kept allowing water to escape and wet the rest of the bathroom.\n",
      "During our stay there was only 2 lifts out of 4 working which caused massive delays between getting between floors due to lifts being full or going straight past our floor.\r\n",
      "This also caused issues to our friend who is pregnant and had to walk down 15 flights of stairs after the lift failed to stop on their floor after 20 mins or waiting.\n",
      "Earlier check-in would be more acceptable.\n",
      "For a hotel of this size, the bar area is very small, particularly when much of it is reserved by diners. It appeared that a large seating area was cordoned off with no-one using it which seemed a waste particularly on a Saturday evening when the terrace was too cold to sit in due to the strong winds. We wanted to be able to have a drink as a family including two 17 year olds who were not allowed access in the evening due to their age (yet a tiny baby was permitted with its parents?). Our children therefore missed out on the opportunity to see the night views from the rooftop terrace. There is no mention of an age limit on the hotel website - they were clearly not looking to drink alcohol as are under age and were accompanied by us, their parents, so this seems unnecessary and is not typical for a hotel that is supposedly geared up for families.\n",
      "The views , the room , and the services was good 😍👌\n",
      " The staff didn t inform us that the toilet glass frosted when a button was pressed no sign in room to say this my girlfriend could not go to the toilet with me being able to see through the glass so spent the night with stomach pain when I told the staff on checking out they found this funny Very upsetting experience for both myself and new girlfriend \n",
      "When we arrived there were no towels and an empty box of tissues but was rectified quickly although they forgot the new box of tissues. Also during breakfast the service was not great as we had to chase 2 people down for our coffee/teas and milk.\n",
      "The shower didn't have a non-slip mat and I fell.\n",
      "breakfast on the day £25.00 each most hotels £10.00 over charged\n",
      "Nothing. All round aces.\n",
      "Got an allergic reaction during the night, maybe because of the air conditioning(?).\r\n",
      "You need to queue for the breakfast.\r\n",
      "No body lotion or hair conditioner.\n",
      "We would have appreciated old school written advice about room and facilities. What was that huge black cylinder in the corner of the room?\n",
      "I did explain that it was my partners birthday. Went upto the roof terrace and was treated quite poorly, made feel very awkward which is upsetting because we wanted to spend the evening having birthday drinks then going back to our room. Checked in at 3/4 and left by 9pm same day. Completely ruined the vibe and us quite upset.\n",
      "2 of the 4 lifts were not working so you had to wait several minutes at busier times...\r\n",
      "The bath/shower partition wasn't quite watertight so it leaked on the bathroom floor\n",
      "Had to queue to check in. Shower didn’t keep water in and flooded the bathroom. Hairdryers take ages to actually dry hair.\n",
      " Paid extra for the executive room which was advertised as having landmark views At arrival was given a room on the East side of the building facing away from London with no landmark views and the only way to have landmark views was to move out of executive room but we were not refunded the difference Saw complaints that the restaurant was open to public and thought this was an unfair complaint however upon trying to go to dinner we were told that no tables were open the rest of the evening and limited times were available the following night Staff often seemed to have the attitude of sorry we can t help you \n",
      "Understaffed and long unsatisfying/ unnecessary waiting lines for breakfast. Room accessories were missing (sleepers) and wasn't able to communicate via phone (nobody answered neither did they called back). Additionally, bathroom accessories (toilet paper, bodywash & shampoo were kept to the minimum, enough for only 1 person, not for the 2 persons for which I had booked). Bathroom sink brought up a bad smell when used. Maybe a drain problem.\n",
      "The property\n",
      "Would be awesome if they had a steam room and some heavier dumbbells in the gym.\n",
      "The only thing wrong being that's its 10 min walk away from the station\n",
      "The cleanliness of the room was so and so. You could notice that they didn't vacuum everyday. Also the bathroom amenities were a bit random. Sometimes no schampoo, but double of shower gel for example. \r\n",
      "Biggest concern was the booking of the NYE event where I was asked to send my reservation to an email which I yet have not received any response from. After speaking to three different staff members (at three different times) I got the message that they were fully booked about 5 hours before the event should start.\n",
      "Room was really hot - took ages to cool down. Coffee at breakfast was undrinkable - way too strong & bitter!\n",
      "Not the hotels fault, but there is building work going on right next door.\n",
      "Changing room for the swimming pool was quite messy and no towels\n",
      "i was extremely disappointed as i booked and paid the room for my son and his girlfriend as a Christmas present when they arrived the staff asked for the card the payment was made on and requested a photo of it so i sent a photo of the card but they then said this was no good the card had to be there my son explained that the room was a gift from me and obviously he would not have my card they said they needed it to cover a damage deposit and room service he said well i can do that with my card but they wouldn't have it so in the end they had to pay for it again on their card and they said they would refund my money which they had already had for 4 weeks after all this which took approximately an hour they then said the room wasn't ready and they then had to wait another hour before they could go in the room\n",
      " The room size is absolutely shocking SUPER small and overrated for what you get Perhaps you pay for the views only but I was very disappointed with the room was expecting more for a deluxe room and for the price \n",
      " I wish i was on a higher floor just to see the view abit more but other than that it was good \n",
      "It's was a shame that the rooftop bar closed at 11 pm.\n",
      "Taxi’s around the area were difficult to get hold of.\n",
      "High bar prices and the service charge in the bar.\n",
      "Bathroom needed some refurb ceiling was all damp. Sheet on bed had marks on it.\n",
      " There was nothing to fault Maybe a couple more Nespresso pods would have been nice \n",
      "Stained towel , breakfast items not replenished\n",
      "Stocked mini fridge, only a still and sparkling water in it. Had there been other options we would have purchased. Also more than one still water would be better.\n",
      "Expensive breakfast\n",
      " Please \n",
      "More coffee in room - a very small point though! Otherwise wonderful!\n",
      "We didn't like our receptionist that wanted to charge us 15 pound extra for basic amenities like a bath robe. The fruit salad at breakfast was overtime, the juices weren't fresh as well...\n",
      "Was perfect everthink\n",
      "We booked an executive room to have access to the executive lounge which didn't exist when we got there\n",
      "I wish that the pool and sauna were 24hrs like the gym. The TV entertainment was pretty basic, no access to the internet or apps like Netflix if you have an apple device as it was an android smart TV.\n",
      "The gym area is small and sparsely.\n",
      "The tea and coffee and sugar in the room was not replenished and yes we could have asked but we were tired and exhausted and wanted it right there and then.. No hotel information regarding check out times or pool opening times in the room.\n",
      " Not much\n",
      "As wonderful as our dinner in the hotel restaurant was - it was quite pricy and we wanted just a quick and affordable bite to eat. We couldn’t eat in the bar as it jam packed with after work drinkers. \r\n",
      "It would have been great to choose another restaurant.\n",
      "Price.\n",
      "Didn’t have the breakfast would like a refund for it if possible just the breakfast\n",
      "Couldn’t find additional bottles of water for the room.\n",
      "Bar shut very early in comparison circa 10pm\n",
      "We had to move room as the was something... brown... splattered on the wall and on the bed. Even though staff were great about it, it put a dampener on the experience for us!\n",
      "Didn’t have enough tea bags in the room.\n",
      "Wi fi was a bit slow .\n",
      "NA, will surely return\n",
      "Staff is super unfriendly! And breakfast is the worst I have ever tried in London hotels.\n",
      "It was abit far away from central London\n",
      " I can t find a single fault\n",
      "Difficult to close shower room door!\n",
      "Not enough staff when there’s lots of people checking in an those already staying have to wait\n",
      "Little overpriced drinks!\n",
      "Transparency on late checkout\n",
      "The staff are the bar were not very attentive.\n",
      "N-a\n",
      "The shower guard in the bath room clearly needs replacing so when the shower was used there was a flood of water on the floor if I had known I would have asked for bath mats but clearly bit late .......\n",
      "Generally lethargic staff in my opinion, especially when I needed something... Getting into breakfast was a bit chaotic, a lot of fuss and disorganised. Room not serviced and towels not changed... I probably book the Hilton next time...\n",
      "Little more bread for breakfast and there was no pen\n",
      " Fitness centre was still work in progress \n",
      "The bed was exceptionally uncomfortable, as was the chair in the room.\r\n",
      "On the whole staff were really helpful but a couple of things let it down such as we asked for cutlery to the room and it never arrived, another rooms dirty room service tray out side our room all afternoon and there was confusion about whether we were allowed to use the roof terrace or not (one staff member said no due to Covid measures and another a few minutes later said it was OK)\n",
      "I have no faults whatsoever, just wished we stayed longer.\n",
      "Everything was good.\n",
      "We couldn’t check in at 3pm but did appreciate the staff sincerity and the vouchers we were given to spend at the bar. There is not much to be honest not to like.\n",
      "The room could of been bigger\n",
      "We paid for a more expensive room (executive) but it was actually smaller than the cheaper room we stayed in before. Next time we wouldn't pay the extra as we didn't really see the difference in that? The veiw was also better in the cheaper room!\n",
      "Staff wasn't super friendly but was accommodating when it counted.\n",
      "no luxury overpriced room too small no reception just laptop and staff\n",
      "To be charged for mini bar after I booked an executive room? The hotel refunded after several phone calls but booking.com need to update their website to say mini bar doesn’t include spirits and mixers, the main Novotel website states this but we were never told this st check in\n",
      "Would of wanted a nicer city view\n",
      " I booked a twin room but the gap between the beds was like a pack of cards which made the twin arrangement non existent Also the staff while helpful were hampered by the use of tablets to check people in it didn t really work \n",
      "Only thing was the showers aren’t very powerful\n",
      "Nothing. All perfect.\n",
      " Nothing everything was spot on \n",
      "All lifts not functional always.... restaurant on 38thfloor gets busy in the evening so difficult for in house guests to get a table with a view.....\n",
      "The room could have been cleaned better\n",
      "We had to wait Almost 2 hours to get checked in so had to wait around at the bar!\r\n",
      "Check in was at 3 we got into our room at 4:45.\r\n",
      "The room wasn’t what We expected from the\r\n",
      "Photos at all, a lot smaller and the views weren’t what I thought I had paid for.\n",
      "It was all very good, no complaints.\n",
      "Being asked by staff whilst you were still eating are you finished, and taking your food away, service on providing coffee slow, no lifts to certain areas stairs a night mare for people with walking disabilities\n",
      "For the price the room felt a little flat pack. No mini bar. And the staff told us we couldn’t get a drink at the rooftop bar when we checked in late but when we went up just to take a look we could.\n",
      " I don t really want to say anything negative because we really enjoyed our time at the hotel but if I can offer a suggestion I think there should be robes and slippers in the room or perhaps available on request also a shower cap in the room especially having waterfall showers I would have appreciated that But overall We loved our stay \n",
      "Check in time was not on time at all kept being told different times \r\n",
      "And after being up very early for traveling it was not very nice when the room was not ready in time\n",
      "The bathroom lights illuminate the whole bedroom at night which disturbed one of us when the other went to the loo. There was half drunk bottles of water left in our mini-fridge.\n",
      " Lights were too bright Bathroom too small Did nt agree with the pre authorisation Do you not trust me to pay my bill \n",
      "Breakfast\n",
      "Room was very corporate which seemed different to the online pictures;\r\n",
      "Wasn't able to find phone number of hotel before booking to see if all facilities were available - unfortunately couldn't use the spa which is one of the main reasons this hotel was chosen.\n",
      "If I had to choose one thing it would be that there was no mirror in the room (apart from bathroom). There was one in the wardrobe door but to be able to straighten and dry my hair I needed to stand at an awkward position to be able to see myself. Having a plug socket in the bathroom would have been handy with the bright mirror or having a mirror on the wall in the bedroom. The plug was around the corner from the wardrobe so it made styling my hair a bit awkward.\n",
      "Sink was blocked, their was no remote for the tv in my room\n",
      "Can't think of anything.\n",
      "Everything!\n",
      "No toilet brush in bathroom\n",
      "When I stayed at the hotel in the past, ataff was was more attentive than this time, but maybe because it was a busy weekend.\r\n",
      "Also, certainly nothing the hotel can do much about, but especially on weekends the lift tends to be full of party folks headed to, or coming from the rooftop bar - which cab be a little annoying\n",
      "Nothing bad about it\n",
      "Hotel was perfect. Unfortunately the surrounding area has building works. Although that didnt impact us from inside the hotel it did however make it hard to get to.\n",
      "Probably more information on things like the lift, you have to tap your room key before pressing a button. I didn't know, ended up on another floor where another member of staff told me. I saw quite a few guests doing the same so I think when checking in it should be explained.\n",
      "Can honestly say there wasn't anything\n",
      "View on 6 floor too hot\n",
      "couldnt find breakfast facilities easily as we werent sure it was the restaurant. So went to reception to check. No biggy!\n",
      "Nothing I can think of\n",
      "I cannot think of. Anything negative\n",
      "the coffee that breakfast was way to strong.\n",
      "Booked for a double bed and was given two single beds to push together instead\n",
      "Room Windows don’t open, it would be nice to get fresh air inside the room\n",
      "We had to wait 40 minutes before we were taken to our room, and we were taken to the wrong room at first, before being given the correct room, which was quite inconvenient.\n",
      "The see through window to the bathroom and loo. Lucky it was my best friend I shared with and didn’t mind her seeing me in the shower or on the loo, but if it had been a romantic weekend, not sure I’d want my other half seeing me on the loo, or even worse if I’d been sharing with a business colleague!!!!\n",
      "Apparently I would have to pay £20+ to use a towelling robe and slippers, which usually come complimentary with a spa hotel. \r\n",
      "I also rang the reception for a late checkout and the receptionist very bluntly told me no. \r\n",
      "The staff upon arrival etc were not welcoming at all and it took ages for me to be served at the bar upstairs despite it not being busy.\n",
      "The aircon outlet was directly above the bed and the air stream was unpleasant even at the lowest setting. The prices at the bar are rather high. We only found out on our last day that you can order extras at the breakfast for free (special coffees, eggs, porridge, etc.). But both points mentioned here are cherry picking.\n",
      " hot breakfast buffet wasn t hot\n",
      "There was a creaking in the bedroom constantly that kept you awake most of the night.\n",
      "Nothing really.\n",
      "Room size could of been abit bigger but good in general\n",
      " Pizzas ordered late at night could be more loaded The room service delivery charge could be included Apart from this everything else was spotless \n",
      "There wasn't much I didn't like about this hotel however, if there was one observation it would be the fact that you have to set up an account at reception before you can charge to your room in the bar\n",
      "no view from the room,\r\n",
      "no bath tub in the room\n",
      "Room wasn’t ready for check-in time was told would need to wait 30-60mins after 15.00 check-in for room.\r\n",
      "Was told in the restaurant that even though booking was for 2people in executive suit, the inclusive breakfast was for 1 person only!! Really annoyed me.\n",
      "Some staff very abrupt and not in any kind of uniform. \r\n",
      "Seats reserved but no one using them.\n",
      "Carpet slightly worn, privacy screen on bathroom still visible outline of people.\n",
      "I anticipated that there would be service on the rooftop terrace, not only the indoor restaurant. The room and pool/gym facilities were satisfactory. There was no bathrobe/slippers in the room, which for the price per night, you would expect. In terms of value, I think there are better options overall.\n",
      "Lifts breaking and out of order all weekend, we weren’t allowed to use stairs, only for staff we were told. No lift maintenance and long queues wo wait for lifts that were working \r\n",
      "Breakfast overflow to bar area, didn’t have all food that was available in the dining area.\n",
      "Checkin a little slow\n",
      "You really need to look at what your booking, they have lots of different rooms and so much to offer so don't rush, take your time when deciding\n",
      "bad smell from the bathroom sink, now cosmetic tissues arent filled up. Breakfast long waiting line, we decide not to wait for the breakfast. Hotel at all is overestimated!\n",
      "Carpets were badly stained, they need a good clean.\n",
      "Pool was beautiful, although it could have been bigger. Breakfast was a bit crowded.\n",
      "Had to remind and ask twice for tea and coffee for room..blind broken on a large window with no curtains to block out light..breakfast hot items poor horrid bacon very greasy and scrambled eggs watery and grey..yuk. staff on duty in breakfast not polite couldn't get sugar for cereal.\r\n",
      "Reception was fine and can't comment on bar or pool as didn't use facilities. Bed too soft and no extra blankets to use. Poor for money paid stayed at better. But great view of canary wharf.\n",
      " There is a lot of construction in the area so the hotel is a bit hard to get to at the moment This is obviously not the hotel s fault \n",
      "12.5% service charge for food and drinks. When questioned near the end of the stay about this we were told we could request that it could taken off any bill but this was not made know/obvious at any point\n",
      "Loved everything\n",
      "Breakfast was very disappointing. Fruit salad was not fresh. Melon in the fruit salad was off. Whole fruit including bananas and apples were all badly bruised and not fresh. Cooked breakfast was ok but not great.\n",
      "My partner pre-order rose petals and chocolate strawberries and even discussed this with the reception as we checked in for a surprise for my 40th, however the strawberries were not in the room when we arrived back after visiting London, when my partner looked into this, and had advised you had run out of strawberries. My Partner was disappointed as he pre-ordered a month or so before and wanted my 40th to be special.\n",
      "Claustrophobic hallways and the decor that looks very dark.\r\n",
      "The bedding had some type of ink stains on it.\n",
      "A bar offering a beer would have been nice\n",
      "Being woken up by the made at 9.30 knocking on the door as we were only staying one night would have been nice for them to check If we was checked out or not. \r\n",
      "Also the breakfast wasnt amazing for the money paid for the room I would expect a breakfast to be cooked fresh not hot food buffet. \r\n",
      "Also the bathroom being in a fish tank so everyone can see you in the room wasnt my idea of a good time and even with the privacy button pushed you could still see\n",
      "Amazing hotel,very good value for money and very convenient for the O2 which was the purpose of the stay.\n",
      "The view wasn’t great but everything else was perfect.\n",
      "The screen between the bath/shower and the bedroom leaked water if anyone was taking a shower. The problem was reported the staff but maintenance had failed to rectify things over the days until we had checked out. That's not exactly what one would expect in a four-star hotel in London zone 2.\n",
      "Breakfast was abit dis organised though, ever so slightly, lack of room to accommodate for the amount of guest, and some table are really small\n",
      "Rooms are pretty standard, nothing special. Clean but had the basics\n",
      "The hairdryers in the rooms and gym changing rooms let you down. I expected those low intensity dryers in the 1980's but not now. I would advise all guests (except those with minimal hair) to bring their own high powered hairdryers.\n",
      "After many phone calls to attempt to ensure that the rooms were next door to each other, and having being promised the day before the booking that 2 were \"external\" interconnecting and the third room was next door, this turned out to be false. Very disappointed with this mistake, but the girls had a super time anyway. Jerome did his best to make things good, and provided some complimentary bubbly for the girls.\n",
      "No parking!\n",
      "Room service menu is very limited and it’s not due to covid 19, it’s been very limited for some time now and I feel such a great hotel but this one thing just let’s the hotel down.\n",
      "A little ways from central London and main tourist attractions, but with the great public transportation, easy enough to get to things.\n",
      "We had room 1801, which is a corner room, and looking at the floor plan diagram is smaller than the other rooms on the floor, I guess it's luck of the draw but a bit crap that you can pay the same for a smaller room and a larger room.\n",
      "Everything was perfect\r\n",
      "Really loved the upgrade for 50th birthday and treats, as wasnt expected it and was a beautiful surprise\n",
      " We came back from a concert and the bar was just closing could do with staying open slightly longer\n",
      "No sauna or steam room\n",
      "A more direct route to the underground would be useful, though this is no reflection on the hotel itself.\n",
      "Plainer menu for dinner - not everyone loves froth on their meals or quinoa.\n",
      "The breakfast was very overpriced in my opinion for what you got. The food was nice but paying £25 each felt like a rip off. The pool/gym facilities were very small. Also there was a male changing in the female changing rooms, there didn’t seem to be anyone around checking that these things weren’t happening.\n",
      "Rooms can be a little bigger\n",
      "Superior double room was a little small\n",
      "All good\n",
      "Our allocated room suffered from a sewerage smell on first night so had to move\n",
      "none\n",
      "Location wasn’t too convenient\n",
      "Very expensive - £200 for one night. Had stayed earlier in the year and it wasn't that expensive, probably as it was a Saturday night.\n",
      " I liked everything\n",
      "The first room I checked in was dirty period stain on the bed the bedding was not made properly the sheets came out easily it was not made at usual hotel standard , I called reception they told me to come down stairs really someone should have come upstairs had a look and apologised there then moved us to our new room even offer complimentary drinks or something.\n",
      "House keeping was very poor\n",
      "2 reception staff were too busy laughing with another guest for 5 minutes AFTER they both finished dealing with what she needed and left me waiting to check in, until a 3rd member of staff who was actually busy prompted one of them to check me in.\r\n",
      "The bathroom lights make the room so bright at night.\n",
      "Pool was a little cold\n",
      "I paid for the deluxe room on the 32nd floor and I got no toothpaste until I called to ask for it, no soap until I called to ask for it, and the room service line was always busy when me or my wife would ring it. Also Break fast as included in my package but the lady said they'll charge me. I wasn't happy with the service.\n",
      "Morning\n",
      "The lifts were difficult to get used to but when you got used to them they were fine but took a little while. There wasn’t a shop local that you could pop into for anything you needed.\n",
      "Perhaps robes in room to go to sauna\n",
      "Cold beans at breakfast and cold mushrooms and no fried eggs. Had spent a lovely morning in the pool and was looking forward to breakfast but the chefs were not keeping notice....\n",
      "The elevator hall was narrow, with quit some waiting queues on peak days.\n",
      "The carpet covered in black stains! I called reception immediately as we where concerned we would be held responsible. Reception visited and offered another room but it would not have the view! I asked why the carpet had not been cleaned? He could not answer!\r\n",
      "Two negatives on staff Chef on breakfast Monday rude and unhelpful refused to cook fresh egg and bacon most items on breakfast Buffy burnt and Security / doorman working in Bokan rude and barred the entry when returning from night out Sunday & Monday never asked if we were residents.\r\n",
      "The mini bar for beer, wine, soft drinks, water and snacks was free only problem was once you drunk the mini bar contents and eaten the snacks only minimal items were replaced, water 1 still bottle.\n",
      " The bathroom windows were very dirty from room into the shower and bathroom itself could have bin better cleaned and also around the bed tables besides that good\n",
      "The carpets were dirty and the beds were hard\n",
      "Very disappointed with the room. I arrived in the late evening. My bathroom sink was blocked. When I ran the tap, the sink filled with stagnant foul smelling water. I contacted reception. It was late in the evening and I wanted to settle for the night due to an important meeting the morning after. It was not appropriate to move at that time. I had to make do. This is not something I would expect from any hotel or B&B and definitely for one I paid over £200 for a night. \r\n",
      "Breakfast did not really have much gluten free options.\n",
      "They should make the gym area abit bigger and they should improve TV, it’s not a smart tv (maybe add better channels and make it easier to connect your phone)\n",
      "The only one small thing we found was that the shower basin was a bit slippery when wet.\n",
      "Bed felt like it had crumbs in it and not made very well. \r\n",
      "Breakfast was cold, so I asked for a new one. They microwaved a breakfast and gave it to me. \r\n",
      "When I left half of my breakfast as it was soggy due to being microwaved. One of the staff (a short black man with short hair) shook his head and said you havent even eaten any of it and questioned me leaving being very rude in the process. I looked back when walking upstairs and he was bad mouthing me to other members of staff. Other than that particulat gentleman, the staff were amazing.\n",
      " Loved it all\n",
      "there was not anything.\n",
      "There are no smoking balconies.There are no smoking areas except on the 38th or ground floor.\r\n",
      "Pool\n",
      "The breakfast was the only thing that didn’t meet our expectations, could have had more of a variety and higher quality - best to just head out somewhere.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Stains on bed sheets were a bit off putting but apart from that everything was great\n",
      "I liked everything :). There is nothing to not like to this place. Even having breakfast/dinner/drink to the last floor, without booking a room in the hotel, would be the best decision ever. I just love this place. It became so close to my heart now and I started to go there from time to time with friends to have a drink in my days off. :)\n",
      " More choice for breakfast as I am a vegan \n",
      "Liked it all\n",
      "Staff very unhelpful \r\n",
      "Very rude \r\n",
      "Didn’t enjoy the stay\n",
      "The checking in situation. The room was booked in my husband's name and because I got there 3 hours before him, I was not allowed to check in without him.\n",
      "Other than having a very noisy couple next door who thought it was acceptable to argue and blast their tv at 5am, can’t fault the hotel itself.\n",
      "The free standing light seemed a bit pointless and would have preferred a more attractive light\n",
      "The cleaner could have cleaned our rooms in the morning or before lunch. We came back to our hotel room in the late afternoon and therefore missed the chance of having room service.\n",
      "Offer local parking options\n",
      "The staff, the room and the service\n",
      "We were charged £63 for breakfast which included a tray charge AND service charge and then asked if we wanted to leave a tip! By the time we sorted it out, the breakfast was cold.\r\n",
      "We stayed at the Novotel as we were attending a concert at the o2. It was only when we were due to leave for the concert that we were told it was a half hour taxi journey with cost £27! We may as well have stayed central!\r\n",
      "It's pushing it to refer to the swimming pool and sauna as a spa. Surprising that there were no dressing gowns provided, given the facilities.\n",
      "We booked a double room, but they gave us two single beds pushed together which was a bit uncomfortable.\r\n",
      "The Bar staff were busy and slightly rude, which may have been down to them being busy.\r\n",
      "We have stayed at this hotel before and did not experience this.\n",
      "Just problem with pipes in bathroom. They started smell very bad on the late evening\n",
      "Great place nice staff very friendly\n",
      "I stayed there twice before and liked it. But the service this time was very basic and we paid our night 409 with no breakfast and no slippers in the room. The tv is not compatible with iPhone. Nothing was done to make our stay better. Quite disappointing.\n",
      "Overall great experience, only details to improve\r\n",
      "1) We got double room instead of twin (and only one blanket)\r\n",
      "2) Only shampoo and shower gel, I would add body lotion\n",
      "Didn't need to change soap & towels every day. Good breakfast just needed to be hotter.\n",
      " Location \n",
      "A bit away from city centre, (15-20 inutes ride by Tube or DLR), but very well located for business travelers who have their interest in Canary Wharf.\n",
      "Room service, Food menu could be better with more choice\n",
      "Small stains on couch but nothing major.\n",
      "Further from stuff to do\n",
      "All of it\n",
      "Nothing! The property was lovely!\n",
      "The only problem with this property was the bathroom did not smell great, it smelt like there was a sewage problem which did cause an issue.\n",
      "Over priced restaurant, particularly breakfast so didn’t have any.\n",
      "There was nothing that we didn’t like we were very pleased with that what we received.\n",
      " Time taken to check in was far too long \n",
      "The bathroom has a clear or matte glass wall facing the windows and the bed, which doesn't seem practical, if you have to go to the toilet at night, as the light from the bathroom lights up the room.\n",
      "While it clearly states there is a GBP50 damage deposit required upon arrival, (card is charged) it should be clearly stated this charge is per night rather than per stay.\n",
      "We asked for maintenance at the front desk because our suitcase handle broke, never heard anything. No welcome book or notice telling us when facilities could be used\n",
      "Shower and sink back filling with water. Sink was fixed on day 2 but shower remained blocked so had to be a quick shower to avoid flooding the bathroom. Reception area very small and cramped with long queues on arrival, not a great start but improved from there.\n",
      "I passed 30 minutes to dry my hair with the hairdryer.\n",
      "Paid before arriving by credit card but when I got there they wanted proof of the credit card, nowhere was this mentioned on the booking so I then had to pay again on my debit card and now waiting for refund on credit card, never heard of this before and it wasn’t made clear\n",
      "No jacuzzi. Water in the pool is a bit cold.\n",
      "The staff specifically emailed me previous to our stay stating that they were excited to personalise our visit. However the stay was for our anniversary and they gave us two single beds on either side of the room, even though I had already paid for a double. Disappointed as I thought they were actually going to make our stay special and instead they made it quite unpleasant.\n",
      " Early check in was 45 which we didn t pay but thought that was slightly over priced\n",
      "The room we got was not the same as the room being advertised on the hotel website. Its either the staff assumes non-caucasian have low standards, or bookings.com took the big portion of the pie, and hence the hotel gave us the less desired rooms. There was no shower gel, and the cafe served us too small pizza for 12 GBP a piece that wasn't even cooked properly. The hotel has no car park which makes it painful for people who drives.\n",
      "Taxi to west end rather expensive.\n",
      " Cold scrambled eggs at breakfast Needs a heater on the roof terrace\n",
      "May be the lights are a bit dark\n",
      "There were no available dental kit/cotton pads, but available upon request. The bath robe however, had a charge to it of 15 pounds.\r\n",
      "I stayed for 2 nights and on both nights I had to call room service to provide me with the in-room water bottles. There weren’t any. Another thing, there was an installed tissue box in the bathroom, hope id see it refilled upon cleaning the room but not to my luck. \r\n",
      "The in-room dining took a good 15 mins to get my ketchup. I was halfway in my meal already. :)\n",
      "Breakfast is terrible. No parking near hotel had to park 12 mins away and walk, parking was £25 for one night\n",
      "I don't like when I cannot open windows in a room to let some fresh air in.\n",
      "The very small towels in the rooms!\n",
      "No full length mirror\n",
      "I am owed £20 as i paid a £50 deposit but 30 was taken for early check in i am owed £20\n",
      "Nothing we loved it all!\n",
      "Nothing. Just the location is a bit far to city center, but quite convenient to take metro.\n",
      " That all Novotels are not like this\n",
      " Very expensive very basic room no robe or slippers for 329 a night\n",

      "All great\n",
      " I would ve liked a mirror in the room not just in the bathroom for hairdrying Bed pillows were unusually large and uncomfortable Hot breakfast was luke warm to cold both days \n",
      "The only issue was I had a suite, but the suite did not come with any glassware, silverware nor bottle openers.\n",
      "The staff. Some of them should really work on their english and friendliness.\r\n",
      "Also no gluten or dairy free options in the restaurant, pizza place or the breakfast buffet\n",
      "The air conditioning is a little temperamental, always too hot or cold, could never get it just right.\r\n",
      "It was sad to see they no longer give bottled water at the breakfast.\n",
      "The staff at the bar in the hotel didn’t take our order for ages and when they eventually did, people who had orderd after us had their drinks before us. Took forever..\n",
      "Both the shower and hairdryer could have been more powerful.\n",
      "The water pressure in the shower was quite weak. This is our only point of improvement that we have for your hotel as everything else was amazing!\n",
      " The breakfast on delivery was cold when delivered to room there was a charge 5 each \n",
      "The restaurant is open to the public on weekends and guests have to share it and the elevators with shady or drunk people. \r\n",
      "Average breakfast (although in a beautiful setting) with rude staff.\n",
      "Family with more than 1kid are not allow to stay in the same room. I really have a bad experience with this hotel. Even they offer the half price for another room, I am not happy that I have to sleep separate from the kids especially the vacation trip.\r\n",
      "I have been stay in many hotel over the world but for this hotel policy is unacceptable. I will not stay in any Novotel hotel again. \r\n",
      "The check in staff especially manager should have more thoughtful and more polite and may be have a bit care of customer feeling. There are a million ways how to talk and negotiated. Even in the end she help, it does not make me feel any better.\n",
      "Perfect\n",
      " I loved everything\n",
      " The protracted booking in process Being asked umpteen questions that were solely for marketing purposes The hotel had only been open 3 weeks but debris had already collected under the bed \n",

      "78 pounds for 2 breakfasts is daylight robbery\n",
      "I found a huge Asian Cockroach in my bathroom. Two of the front desk staff were pretty unhelpful saying that there were no other rooms. However, the female front desk person was supportive and the Night Manager was helpful and resolved the issue (moved me to another room.)\n",
      "There was nothing we did not like, if I had to give some feedback it would be the lifts, 3/4 were working for the full 3 days we were there and 2/4 on our last day.\n",
      "Little further to walk to tube than advertised\n",
      "I would have preferred if the breakfast went on a little later maybe till 11am\n",
      "A long walk from the underground\n",
      "Breakfast on 38th floor.\n",
      "The hotel should invest in good hairdryers.\n",
      "Receptionist made the effort to book us in a time slot for the pool when no one else would be there, however when we arrived there was swimming lessons taking place so we had to share the pool with numerous young children splashing about.\n",

      " Dressing Gowns would have been a welcomed extra for use in room adding comfort following a well earned shower Roof Top Terrace as reviewed was amazing however if you are not a smoker this could cause you not to hang around Smokers were free to smoke anywhere on the terrace which spoiled the experience As a non smoker having someone sat next to us smoking was off putting and feel that the terrace should be free for all to enjoy Smokers should have an area away from everyone else should they need to have a smoke keeping the rest of the terrace smoke free I asked for 2 Jack Daniel s and coke total cost was 22 50 be warned the bar staff will automatically pour a double shot unless you tell them otherwise JD cost 7 00 each and a small bottle of coke was 3 00 20 00 then we had 12 5 service charge added 2 50 \n",

      "The bathroom had a lot of noisy gurgles every time you used a tap. Twin beds with no separation between them.... Why? Also the worst tea I have ever tasted was served at breakfast, even when we asked for a pot instead of the mugs it was horrible.\n",
      "Maybe the lifts could have been a bit better but It was lovely!\n",
      "Glass which separated room from bathroom.\n",
      " Rooms little small but this is London\n",
      "Lifts took a long time, and some doors not clearly labelled (I.e where’s the changing rooms) \r\n",
      "Be nice if all rooms ha dressing gowns\n",
      " Not enough toiletries for two people \n",
      "the bar staff were a bit surly\n",
      "The view, the room and bar at the top were all great!\n",
      "Breakfast was very good albeit at £25 somewhat expensive, otherwisevnothing under your control.....all the building work still going on in the area.\n",
      "It is a little far out if you are looking at spending time in the centre of london however the trains are so easy that it wasnt really a problem.\n",
      "Hotel was decent, definitely not a 9.0. shower head was dirty, peeling paint in shower, sink dirty. Some tissue stuffed in a hole in the bathroom. My card has been replaced by my bank so the original payment card was thrown away, but had to still repay for the room and wait a week for a refund.\n",
      "Lifts, wait for too long for lifts, lifts often don’t stop on residents floor because of capacity, especially when top roof garden bar is open.\n",
      "No contactless payment/ Apple Pay in the bar which seems slightly outdated. Now so used to being able to use this everywhere, I left my purse in my room and had to run back down to grab my card. \r\n",
      "We chose not to have breakfast as £28 each, whether full English or not, even in London is pretty extortionate.\n",
      "The only downside was the lack of a bath and perhaps the comfort of the bed wasn’t to my liking.\n",
      "Not sure if they provide less of toiletries or were not places in our room. For example, there was no moisturiser or a shower cap which I think is available in all the hotels in similar category.\n",
      "The pool was lovely but a little small, and got very busy in the time we were there. I also would have liked some info in the room about facilities, although these were mentioned to us at check in so not a big deal.\n",
      "Following on from the top paragraph box - In which he was very rude and commented back \"so you aren't staying in the hotel tonight\" I had already told him no! I was shocked and quite frankly embarrassed the way we were treated by two security guards and a few members of staff! Absolutely shocking!! We first came to this hotel when it was brand new and just opened, it was amazing but now it seems like you have employed the most arrogant security guards who do not care about the guests! In which case is very bad as this will stop a lot of your loyal guests from coming back! I am also extremely angry as when we got our suitcase back the handle had broken, this wasn't the case when we handed it in to be stored safely for the day? (I'm happy to send pictures) The only thing we could think of is if someone had forced the suitcase handle down causing it to break, not realizing you need to hold a button in for it to go down? I understand this is awkward however surely if you're looking after guests luggage the staff would be more careful and not force or break the luggage! This wasn't exactly a cheap suitcase so my partner and I are more than just a little angry in regards to this situation. I am very sad that I have had to write this sort of review as I was expecting to write a brilliant one as always. All in all the Executive Suite was very beautiful, well laid out and spotless. Our room was amazing which made our stay just that little bit better. I would like to thank the staff that sorted out our room, and also gave us the little treats and birthday card it was a lovely gesture. I just cannot put into anymore words how extremely disappointed and upset we are in regards to the issues caused.\n",
      "Customer service was standard, In line with expectations but in my opinion not in line with the excellent hotel.\n",
      "Lack of shower gel, lack of jacuzzi in swimming pool complex\n",
      "The breakfast was not nice, flavour off and some things under cooked\n",
      "Nothing, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay\n",
      "The air condition was too loud at night and not really reflecting the temperature we’ve set.\r\n",
      "25 GBP per person for a common breakfast was too high.\n",
      "I paid extra to be between the 30-35th floor specifically to be on the side to see the shard and asked for this in advance as it was my boyfriends first visit to London. I was facing a building site. I could’ve paid much less and got a room on a lower floor with a better view. The whole point of booking that room is for the view. Was told when I was there that they had no more rooms between those floors with any other view than of an unfinished building. Was gutted to say the least\n",
      "Rooms are ok in their design for a 4* hotel, not poor by any means, but definitely nothing special\n",
      "Bring your own hairdryer if you'll need to dry your hair - the provided one is useless if you have any more hair than a buzz cut.\n",
      "The bar and terrace got very busy and had to wait some time in order to use the bar on the terrace.\n",
      "Omelette could be improved it was tasteless\n",
      "We needed to call the reception for coffee and soap on day two. So if they clean up the room you they don't refresh the soaps and the coffee. The towels that were wet on the hooks the cleaning staff rolled up to pretend they were fresh. \r\n",
      "On the check out we didn't got the question if everything was OK...A friendly good morning and a smile would make a difference.....A give a good score for staff just because there were good staff members to. Hygiene and customers satisfaction is not there top priority or they need to train some members.\n",
      "The shield of shower booth. Water leaked from the shower booth.\n",
      "Drinks and the restaurants was more expensive than expected. Location of the hotel is far from central London\n",
      "Had to ask for a kettle for a cup of tea in the room. No big deal.\n",
      "The 3 toenails found on first bathroom floor, we were given another room straight away\n",
      " The Shower was all glass and you could see through to the beds \n",
      "The security on the top floor at the bar was very intimidating and made me not want to go to the bar. Our shower leaked ever so slightly but I'm sure they will sort it as we let them know at the end of our stay.\n",
      "I had to leave\n",
      "The lack of hot water in the shower but sadly this was the whole hotel and I wouldnt mark the hotel down for it as it was unfortunate and didnt happen last time I went.\n",
      "Bit too much development going on around the hotel. Noise didn’t bother us at all just dirt on roads and dig up parhways\n",
      "The location of the toilet roll was a little awkward.\n",
      "Check in is rally slow and differcult. \r\n",
      "We booked a double room and was given a twin room. When we complained about this in reception we were lied to and that all the hotel beds are like that and they would join the beds together. However we didn’t buy that bulls**t story and after arguing for around 19 mins we asked for a refund, now somehow they have brought a double bed Friday night at 10pm. This showed that they operate dishonestly as the Room we got in the end was a double bed not two twins joined together as we originally told and that they don’t have any double beds in the hotel. We weren’t told that no double bed rooms weren’t avavilble but they don’t have double beds at all.... lol what a load of bull.\n",
      "There was a bit of confusion with our check in, but it was quickly solved.\n",
      "Not enough milk in the rooms. Drains in bathroom were a bit smelly. Great location especially the view from rooftop bar.\n",
      " Cleaning schedules were confusing\n",
      "Bar staff - waited over 20 mins to get served in the bar. Bar staff did not pay attention to people waiting\r\n",
      "TV didn't work properly, kept switching itself off\n",
      "I actually like everything\n",
      "Nothing bad in my opinion. Maybe just a little expensive even though i tried to book 6 months ahead from now\n",
      "No direct resturants and bars and couldn't get room service cos was hour weight not good as nowhere right near to get food breakfast was little lukewarm warm\n",
      "The size of the room very small no unless you get a suite it’s a waste of money\n",
      "The hotel is slightly further away from subway station than we expected more like a 10-15 min walk and it did take around 10 mins to get into most of the main tourist attractions. The hotel is situated in a business area so may need to travel a wee bit to find busy restaurants and bars but that's part of the fun of being in a new city!\n",
      "Terrible stay, issues listed below:\r\n",
      "1. Charged for a breakfast rate room, when we did not select this at booking\r\n",
      "2. Bokan bar staff come across as terribly rude\r\n",
      "3. Air con terrible\r\n",
      "4. We checked in for one night, yet were woken by maids performing room cleaning at 9am on a saturday!\r\n",
      "5. Also woken by the sound of window cleaners clambering down the building in the winch, eventually stopping outside our window all from 9am onwards on a saturday morning... Shocking.\r\n",
      "6. Bed was like sleeping on wood, which management clearly realise as there were around 3 mattress protectors / additional foam layers on top of the mattress itself. \r\n",
      "All in all, this hotel is dreadful. Oh and £30 for a breakfast pot of yoghurt / berries & eggs on toast? Talk about robbing the blind. I’ll never stay here again for leisure or work, would rather sleep under the desk in my office over the road!\n",
      "The view could be better\n",
      "It can be a bit pricey to stay here, but when you get a good rate it’s wirth it.\n",
      "As above\n",
      " Little bit out of the way for us but depends on where you are intending to visit \n",
      "Room advertised as a city view ,but youcould only see it if you stood up and look round window .I had requested a nice view as it was a surprise for my partner. We also had brunch which was tasteless\n",
      "The only two things I really missed: bath in my room and better coffee. Your current coffee is ok but in my opinion that's the only thing that can be easily improved.\n",
      "Not a lot of choices for breakfast.\n",
      "The pool area couldn’t have a hot tub that would’ve made it even better\n",
      "Bangers & mash in the bar -very odd\n",
      "Wasn’t the cheapest in the area for the same rating.\n",
      "The price could be cheaper\n",
      "The sink in our bathroom was a bit slow to drain, but really that was the only issue we had.\n",
      "Pillows could have been better\n",
      "Lifts vital in 38 storey hotel, and 2 of 4 were out of action at check out time. However I’m sure this was unusual.\n",
      "The view from our room and the Bokan bar were amazing. It’s nice to actually view central London from afar instead of being in amongst it. The location is ideal for getting to and from the 02 arena which is only 1 tube stop away.\n",
      "Nothing to complain about.\n",
      "Sky bar is a little pricey but expected for our stay on NYE\n",
      "Swimming pool is small. Receptionists do not answer to call quickly\n",
      "Too far from a lot of things \r\n",
      "The breakfast did not taste too good, not many choices for a vegan.\n"
