Bed was big and comfortable, which is always a big deal to us as my husband is 6'8. Most hotels have much smaller, less comfortable beds, so mostly we rarely sleep well at other hotels, but we both managed to get a pretty decent night at the Hilton. Air con was lush too. Staff were very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Their own car park was full when we arrived, but we were directed to another secure car park, very close by, easy to find with similar charges, which helped us avoid what is normally a pretty stressful situation, as parking in London is rarely an easy task. Very close to public transport, train station is just over the river, bus stops right outside the hotel which made it very easy for us to travel all over London before returning to the hotel where they have 24 hour staff available. Facilities in the room were perfect.\n",

      "After my previous birthday stay at Hilton Canary Wharf, I arrived expecting another great experience. Unfortunately this was far from the case. Not only had the service standards dropped with staff unclear of how to conduct the simplest requests appearing to be in a state of confusion, but my card was also charged twice, wiping nearly £1,000 from my account. My bank investigated the matter, finding that Hilton had made a massive error with the transaction. I then contacted Hilton who couldn't have been more unhelpful if they tried. Not one member of staff took responsibility, constantly trying to blame myself and the bank even though it has been proved otherwise. As a student and charity worker travelling to London for soccer aid, I am now currently in a state of massive financial strain as a result of the error made by Hilton which has totally ruined my trip and experience of my many Hilton stays. Warning signs began when I phoned room service, to be told that \"If you can just give me quite a while to get back to you\" when I enquired about ordering a pizza. What does that even mean? What kind of service is that? Safe to say the phonecall never came, and when I did phone again I was hung up on a further twice. As a regular hilton guest, I am angry, upset and massively disappointed at what has happened. It has left a real bitter taste in my mouth.\r\n",

      " The staff were fantastic I really have to praise the restaurant staff for responding to quickly and effectively to a comment I made after my meal in the restaurant I happened to say that I felt the cost of the chicken supreme was out of proportion to the size of the portion I was not expecting anything to be done as it is a London hotel and therefore I expect prices to be high However I was pleasantly surprised when a waiter brought a complimentary desert to me as I sat in the lounge later on Then the resturant manager I think or perhaps the duty manager came over to explain that he had read my comment card and wanted to make up for the small portion hence the desert That was good enough in terms of service recovery but it got better because when I checked out the whole meal had been taken off my bill Really above and beyond what I expected but very much appreciated So I would happily return to the hotel because I feel I can trust them do what they can to make me feel valued \n",

      "The bed in my room unfortunately was not very comfortable at all and was the low point of my stay at the Hilton, (which was very unexpected of a hotel of this calibre!). It did mean that I did not feel I had as much of a restful night as I thought I would receive at the Hilton (I do like my beauty sleep!), so this factor unless I the reason being I just had a 'duff' bed, is a game changer for me whether I will book into this hotel again in the future.\n",

So we phoned reception and the girl who answered said that she would put me through to restaurant reservations. However after some 10 mins of hanging on the phone with nobody getting back to us we hung up and decided to eat somewhere else. We have eaten in your restaurant before and enjoyed the food so if we could have received more help with making a reservation we would have eaten there again.\n",

      " I am not sure why many hotels including this one fail to understand the single most important element that makes people go to hotels to get a good night sleep It is impossible to do that if you have a bad bed and or bad pillows I am not sure if it is the room that we got but I could feel the springs in my bones and the pillows were just terrible all 5 of them for a name like Hilton that should be unacceptable so If getting a good night sleep is not important than I think this hotel is probably OK but if like me you care about getting up in the morning feeling like you got some decent sleep then this ppty is not 4u \n",

I booked a packaged as part of my booking for my partner’s birthday and on arrival there was items missing in the room which I had to chase up.

The most disappointing was the service in the bar. we wanted to get a quick bite to eat but was 35 mins early to be seated in the actual restaurant (opens at 5pm) so we opted for their bar menu instead. We ordered beef burger with cheese and the southern fried chicken burger along with some drinks. Our order took us over an hour to be served and we have chased out order up at least three times as people after us are being served before us (annoying). We did get offered a comp drink at the bar but a bit poor considering we only ordered two burgers with chips which does take over an hour to cook? At the end, the taste didn’t even make it worth while as it was bland especially the southern fried chicken which you would expect to be spiced. We ended up ordering Deliveroo instead and it was not only cheaper but much tastier. Sausages at breakfast could be improved as it tasted cheap and for a 4 star hotel, it didn’t scream quality.\n",

Also at one stage we called for some drinking water to the room which even after a second called seemed to be ignored, I gave up with waiting and walked round the corner to buy a bottle from the local Tesco’s. One of the biggest gripes I had though throughout the whole experience was the lacklustre social distancing being applied in the dining area at breakfast not to mention they charge for a full breakfast but don’t really offer a full breakfast. Also I stayed in a king suite room which had a pullout sofa bed that clearly hadn’t been cleaned before hand as there were packets of crisps left inside from previous guests overall extremely dissatisfied with the whole experience and certainly will not stay there.

Better if you resever a place when booking. Also breakfast isnt inculded in the price and its very expriance for a breakfast so we left it and had breakfast out. Breakfast should be included in the price for how much you pay for the room.\n",
      " The hotel took from my credit card double the amount that was needed for my room and they explained that once was for the reservation once the actual payment a crazy explanation The amount was withheld for at least two weeks before being returned Quite an inconvenience to be honest especially since this makes no sense whatsoever to be charged double what you owe \n",

      "No tea/coffee facilities in the room. After a 10 hour travel to get there it would’ve been nice to find tea/coffee was available in the rooms, especially when paying over £100 for one night. Also after ‘looking’ at the items in the mini bar, I must’ve moved a small bottle of wine and a chocolate bar, my debit card was charged over £12 for this, they are of course refunding this charge but be sure not to TOUCH or move anything in the mini bar if you don’t want to be charged for it and have to wait up to 7 days to get your money back.\n",

      " The bed is uncomfortable It s old and very hard it should be replaced The ventilation is very noisy we had to turn it off during the night Cleaning could be better A comment about the breakfast service the staff works hard but I see a lack of organization The hotel was full during our stay and clearly the breakfast room wasn t large enough We had to wait in line to have a table There is only one island with water and juices and a full tank was emptied in less than 10 minutes There was a continuos shortage of stock of dishes and glasses The servers were running at full speed all the time and in all directions I feel like they were seriously understaffed Everyone had to do everything exemple the person at the reception had to leave a couple of times to serve coffee while people was waiting in line I understand the unusual peak of customers during Easter days but it looked like the management left the usual staff cover all the overcharge This is poor management IMHO they had to enforce the team and the facilities during these days I ve felt bad for the staff they were working way over their capacity The situation was chaotic \n",
      " I didn t have a bad experience the car park was full so had to park elsewhere I stayed in a Hilton Hotel in Glasgow back in 1994 Comparable to my recent stay at The Hilton it s just not an extra special place hotel to stay anymore The standard of The Hilton now is the same as many hotels it does not distinguish itself above the competition anymore It s always the little things choice of furniture pictures etc etc The 1 s of effort here and there People have an eye for interior design because of the focus on interior design in the home and we can tell when things are little bit below a high standard or quality however people will accept less The Hilton is good not Excellent it used to be \n",

The surprise was then ruined as I had to call the front desk to request this. When mentioning this on check out I was told the bottle would be complementary, by a manager, however I was still charged.

      "There was a leak in the bathroom: the shower door on tub was leaking quite badly onto the floor creating a pool of water. I notified hotel staff who 'fixed it' but it wasn't fixed. The next day the problem continued and still not fixed. They deducted the one breakfast and dinner at check out (total of £60 - half of nightly rate) when I complained for a third time rather than 1) changing the room when there were rooms available, or 2) deducting a day's stay in compensation for their failure to address the problem and meet the guests' needs, or 3) giving a complimentary night stay in the future. The cleanliness and room service was excellent - no complaint there.

      " Following two nights of blissful sleep I awakened on the third morning at 4 10 am to the noise of scratching and fiddling at my bedroom door This went on a while which bewildered me but I was ok and tried to go back to sleep Then I really woke up when I heard my locked door closing and it terrified me It transpired that it was my Express CheckOut form being delivered and I can only assume whoever was delivering it simply couldn t get it underneath my door all the scratching about and had quickly opened ians closed the door to get it through easier As a lone female sleeping on top of the bed I didn t realis this and was really scared It took me a while to calm down and get back to sleep I would have rung reception to complain but needed to sleep as I was driving home that morning and so needed to relax On leaving I informed reception of my horror and dismay that this had happened and was told they would take me off Express Checkout at all their hotels so it couldn t happen again That felt like a punishment as opposed to a real apology and has actually made me reconsider staying at a Hilton in the future as I felt as though the implication was that no one else would have been worried about their door suddenly opening Totally missing the point that not only had my sleep been disturbed I then had to really work at calming down and not letting my fears run away with me It must have taken me a good ten minutes to work out why it might have happened as my initial reaction had been real fear followed by checking whether my belongings had been disturbed etc as I was half asleep and couldn t quite comprehend why my door had opened and or whether anyone had actually been in my room In the cold light of day I could tell that no one had entered but at that time I had no idea I didn t get back to sleep for well over an hour later and had to read to take my mind off how vulnerable I now felt \n",

       " Following two nights of blissful sleep I awakened on the third morning at 4 10 am to the noise of scratching and fiddling at my bedroom door This went on a while which bewildered me but I was ok and tried to go back to sleep Then I really woke up when I heard my locked door closing and it terrified me It transpired that it was my Express CheckOut form being delivered and I can only assume whoever was delivering it simply couldn t get it underneath my door all the scratching about and had quickly opened ians closed the door to get it through easier As a lone female sleeping on top of the bed I didn t realis this and was really scared It took me a while to calm down and get back to sleep I would have rung reception to complain but needed to sleep as I was driving home that morning and so needed to relax On leaving I informed reception of my horror and dismay that this had happened and was told they would take me off Express Checkout at all their hotels so it couldn t happen again That felt like a punishment as opposed to a real apology and has actually made me reconsider staying at a Hilton in the future as I felt as though the implication was that no one else would have been worried about their door suddenly opening Totally missing the point that not only had my sleep been disturbed I then had to really work at calming down and not letting my fears run away with me It must have taken me a good ten minutes to work out why it might have happened as my initial reaction had been real fear followed by checking whether my belongings had been disturbed etc as I was half asleep and couldn t quite comprehend why my door had opened and or whether anyone had actually been in my room In the cold light of day I could tell that no one had entered but at that time I had no idea I didn t get back to sleep for well over an hour later and had to read to take my mind off how vulnerable I now felt        1\n",
