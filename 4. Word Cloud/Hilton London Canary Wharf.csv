289,Clare,United Kingdom,Double Guest Room,2 nights ·  October 2019,Group,Reviewed: 28 October 2019,Great price and location for a weekend break,The hotel was a short walk from South Quay DLR station and Canary Wharf.

290,Janine,United Kingdom,Double Guest Room,1 night ·  October 2019,Couple,Reviewed: 27 October 2019,Good stay but not a 4 stay quality service,"The room allocated to us was clean and tidy. Decent size for a standard double room. Had hair dryer and iron and ironing board which is always handy. The bathroom was clean complete with essentials such as shower gel, shampoo, conditioner etc. Executive lounge had good selection of food and drinks in the evening and continental breakfast. Breakfast at the restaurant has good selection.The location of the hotel was perfect as we were attending an event at The O2. The receptionist that checked us in was lovely and helpful and Meritxell who has been accommodating and helpful helping me arrange my booking.","For a well known 4 star hotel service was average. I booked a packaged as part of my booking for my partner’s birthday and on arrival there was items missing in the room which I had to chase up. Went to the executive lounge and our cards didn’t work but was sorted when the attendant arrived and programmed our cards. The most disappointing was the service in the bar. we wanted to get a quick bite to eat but was 35 mins early to be seated in the actual restaurant (opens at 5pm) so we opted for their bar menu instead. We ordered beef burger with cheese and the southern fried chicken burger along with some drinks. Our order took us over an hour to be served and we have chased out order up at least three times as people after us are being served before us (annoying). We did get offered a comp drink at the bar but a bit poor considering we only ordered two burgers with chips which does take over an hour to cook? At the end, the taste didn’t even make it worth while as it was bland especially the southern fried chicken which you would expect to be spiced. We ended up ordering Deliveroo instead and it was not only cheaper but much tastier. Sausages at breakfast could be improved as it tasted cheap and for a 4 star hotel, it didn’t scream quality.",7.9

Canary Wharf is not a very central location for tourists, however, the largish rooms, air con, and relative lack of traffic noise ( my room was at the rear of the building ) more than compensates. In addition the hotel is a few minutes walk from the DLR and Jubilee line which provide frequent and efficient transport to the centre.

We were looking for a 4 star value hotel, in a convenient location and close to Tube with reasonable Carpark charges and this hotel not only ticked the boxes, but also went beyond that!!
With ample secure carparking spaces, accessed directly via hotel reception, great staff and hospitality during arrival and throughout our stay, we fully enjoyed our stay.
Check-in was quick and straighforward with glasses of champagne on arrival while kids were provided with free easter chocolates & soft drinks together were easter freebies and colouring pens at the reception and within dining areas to keep them busy and entertained!
Hotel location was a big bonus as it was close to 2 tube stations. We had to use the Canary Wharf station as DLR line was under maintenance but Canary Wharf was just a short walking distance over the canal via a suspension bridge next to the hotel.
Canary Wharf area was a nice location itself for having a walk and enjying the various architecturally designed/constructed buildings and surrounding streets, shops and landscapes; everything was well designed and newly built.. so relaxing for a walk around.
Being on a business location, we were under the impression that the area may be quite and insecure on a non-business day but it was so crowded and lively with people in the shops, restaurants and bars during the easter weekend till late night. Several shopping centres around the Canary Wharf station with several restaurant dining options on top of hotel's Cinnamon Dining venue were available to choose from. Also there were street food kiosks available next to the hotel, serving vaiety of burgers, smoothies and juices.
The communal areas were well decorated and clean.The room was airconditioned, spacious and comfortable.","Our room was located on the 6th floor and as the DLR track was next to the building, occasionally the DLR line's noise was heard when a train was passing during the operation hours but it was generally quite for the night sleep.",10

So that was an amazing surprise! Room was very clean and spacious. Bed was big and comfortable, which is always a big deal to us as my husband is 6'8. Most hotels have much smaller, less comfortable beds, so mostly we rarely sleep well at other hotels, but we both managed to get a pretty decent night at the Hilton. Air con was lush too. Staff were very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Their own car park was full when we arrived, but we were directed to another secure car park, very close by, easy to find with similar charges, which helped us avoid what is normally a pretty stressful situation, as parking in London is rarely an easy task. Very close to public transport, train station is just over the river, bus stops right outside the hotel which made it very easy for us to travel all over London before returning to the hotel where they have 24 hour staff available. Facilities in the room were perfect.","The room we stayed in could've done with a few more plug sockets, ideally on both sides of the bed. But I find this with pretty much every hotel I've ever stayed in! There was also no hair dryer in the room, but I always bring my own anyway. Would've been nice if there were a few more items from room service available 24 hour. Other than that, everything was amazing. Very hard to find any faults!",10

Unfortunately this was far from the case. Not only had the service standards dropped with staff unclear of how to conduct the simplest requests appearing to be in a state of confusion, but my card was also charged twice, wiping nearly £1,000 from my account. My bank investigated the matter, finding that Hilton had made a massive error with the transaction. I then contacted Hilton who couldn't have been more unhelpful if they tried. Not one member of staff took responsibility, constantly trying to blame myself and the bank even though it has been proved otherwise. As a student and charity worker travelling to London for soccer aid, I am now currently in a state of massive financial strain as a result of the error made by Hilton which has totally ruined my trip and experience of my many Hilton stays. Warning signs began when I phoned room service, to be told that ""If you can just give me quite a while to get back to you"" when I enquired about ordering a pizza. What does that even mean? What kind of service is that? Safe to say the phonecall never came, and when I did phone again I was hung up on a further twice. As a regular hilton guest, I am angry, upset and massively disappointed at what has happened. It has left a real bitter taste in my mouth.
