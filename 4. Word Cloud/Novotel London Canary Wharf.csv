0,Silviu,Montenegro,Superior Double Room with City View,3 nights ·  July 2019,Couple,Reviewed: 16 July 2019,Exceptional,"the view from the double deluz room at 28th floor is breatthtaking... no to mention the restaurant on top. If you include breakfast(and if you ask me, it's a must!) you eat it there at the restaurant on top of the hotel with the amazing view. Great way to start the day",I added an extra day to the reservation via phone call but the payment didn't go through and I wasn't notified about this... I had to deal witht the issue on site when I arrived. Luckily it was resolved to the same room but it was only by chance.. since they could have given the room away.,10

16,Lizzy,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ·  November 2020,Couple,Reviewed: 2 November 2020,Birthday Trip 🍾,"WOW...
This hotel is honestly one of the best I’ve ever stayed in. From the moment we arrived, to the minute we checked out, everything was incredible 🤩
I’d booked it pretty last minute, for my boyfriend and I to celebrate his birthday. I emailed the hotel in advance to let them know it was a special occasion. Upon arriving at the hotel, one of the lovely ladies at reception (I didn’t catch her name) was so welcoming and told us everything we needed to know.
After checking in, we went up to our room on the 17th floor (1706). WOW x2! The room was spotlessly clean, and was honestly better than I could have ever hoped. The highlight was probably the amazing view of the city skyline. Seeing London at sunset, lit up at night and waking up to it in the morning was incredible.
Upon exploring the room, we came across a birthday card and caramel chocolate left for my boyfriend - such a nice touch. It sounds a bit odd, but we also couldn’t get over how nice the bathroom was! I mean the glass wall in the shower frosts with the touch of a button... we even took a video 😂
After checking in, we went down to use the pool. Again, everything was perfect. The changing rooms were so nice and clean and the pool was beautiful! Great temperature and the perfect way to unwind after travelling into Canary Wharf from Essex.
After using the pool, we came back up to our room to order a snack and a few drinks via room service. Great service again - the fries, along with a couple of beers, with our view of London went down a treat!
We didn’t visit the hotel restaurant (Bokan) for dinner, but we did go up to the bar later on that night. The service was impeccable once again, and the rooftop bar has the best 360 degree views of london 🥂
Honestly, don’t even hesitate to book this hotel!",Everything was perfect!,10

Bar food chicken teriyaki wasn’t cooked and potato skins where rock hard but spoke to staff and had complementary drink.

It also smelled amazing in the lobby area when coming in.,If I had to choose one thing it would be that there was no mirror in the room (apart from bathroom). There was one in the wardrobe door but to be able to straighten and dry my hair I needed to stand at an awkward position to be able to see myself. Having a plug socket in the bathroom would have been handy with the bright mirror or having a mirror on the wall in the bedroom.

Rooms are nice and we were lucky to have room on the 27th floor. I love the fact dogs are allowed (for additional £25). I ordered food to my room, but it was delayed (took over an hour instead of 45min promised), but stuff was professional enough to give me a discount for this delay, so great service.","Check-in was a bit long, stuff asked me to wait like 15min while they checking my room, but no one told me once it has been done, so I probably waited longer than I should and had to come back myself to ask again. Also, I haven't been told about the facilities, opening times etc.. No information at all and this is a second time at this hotel when I receive no information at check-in. You should tell your stuff on reception to give more information to the guests.
Also, the lifts aren't working well. Most of the times we had to wait like 5min to get downstairs, although there are about 6 lifts. Also, when we wanted to go from 38th floor (where the bar is) to our room (27th floor), we took last lift (the one on the far right) and in that lift we could not get anywhere apart from the ground floor, because that lift seems like is built for external restaurant visitors only. On the ground floor that lift doors open on the other side, so you can only go outside the hotel, not a reception, so that was really confusing and we had to go outside and come in via the main entrance. You should put a title above that lift to inform guests who are staying in hotel to not use it.",9.0

445,Tom,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ·  June 2019,Couple,Reviewed: 21 June 2019,Excellent hotel & a perfect getaway,"The hotel has the height and the hype that goes with the surroundings of Canary Wharf. From it’s contemporary, edgy feel of the interiors, to its grande magnitude in scale and its breathtaking views from the rooms, and rooftop. It really is a spectacular getaway. At night the city lighting up your room glistens beautifully. The bed was well equipped with a lovely mattress topper and feather soft pillows, we stayed on the 28th floor and my word I’d recommend upgrading to a deluxe double, for supreme views, comfort and 24hour room service. Everything about that room was curiosity. Many different buttons and gadgets in built to add subtle charming effects to your experience. Ingenious little things which overall gave such a massive impression on us.
Breakfast wise, continental breakfast was tastier than your authentic English, but the food tastes that much better when it’s taken in with the spectacular views of the 38th floor. The hotel was exceptionally clean throughout and the staff were lovely, helpful and friendly. The pool is a lot smaller than the photos suggest, but the creativity continue in the pool with buttons that allow you to pour down a mini waterfall feature into the pool, along with a rapids machine. The water was crystal clear and the facilities were fantastic but I would say that more than 6 people in the pool at once would be a crowd - I’d suggest to swim in the evening or the morning to avoid being on top of each other.
The 39th floor has a rooftop bar and some of the most incredible skylines I have ever seen in London. I like the location, being a 7min walk from the Canary Wharf tube station and a 30min tube to the centre of London is really nice. Means you can get the feeling of escaping and come home to relax.
I would say that I was expecting a bigger room however, and that you are ultimately paying for one of the best views in London rather than the best rooms in London.",Not Available,9.6

Rooftop terrace views were fantastic.,"For a hotel of this size, the bar area is very small, particularly when much of it is reserved by diners. It appeared that a large seating area was cordoned off with no-one using it which seemed a waste particularly on a Saturday evening when the terrace was too cold to sit in due to the strong winds. We wanted to be able to have a drink as a family including two 17 year olds who were not allowed access in the evening due to their age (yet a tiny baby was permitted with its parents?). Our children therefore missed out on the opportunity to see the night views from the rooftop terrace. There is no mention of an age limit on the hotel website - they were clearly not looking to drink alcohol as are under age and were accompanied by us, their parents, so this seems unnecessary and is not typical for a hotel that is supposedly geared up for families.",9.2

733,Siobhan,United Kingdom,Executive Suite,1 night ·  January 2019,Couple,Reviewed: 23 January 2019,Not as great as our last few stays unfortunately!,"I regret having to write this review as I'm usually writing the most amazing reviews about Novotel Canary Wharf. However, our stay this time was quite disappointing to say the least. My partner (Joshim Uddin) booked an Executive Suite for my birthday as this is one of our favorite hotels. The night of our stay we went up to Bokan to get a drink as it was my birthday, I got told the bar shuts at midnight so we went up at 11PM to give us enough time to sit and have one drink. We got approached by a security guard lady (unsure of her name but can give description) She stated to us that the bar was closed, we advised we're staying at the hotel and just come up for one drink as we got told it closed at midnight. She then went over to speak to a lady who then allowed us to buy one drink. However, this whole time we felt very uncomfortable and un-welcomed by the staff / security standing around and staring so we went up to the rooftop, we then got approached by another girl who told us the bar is now closed, we stated we know and we already have our drink. However, she just stood a few feet away from us waiting for us to leave, so in the end we just took our drinks back to our room! This had ruined our night completely and we were and still are angry at how we got treated! We were very gutted as we were debating on staying an extra night with you guys but after the first night we just knew it wouldn't make us happy. The day of check out, we left our luggage at the hotel and came back to get them around 9PM, we decided to relax in the members lounge area for an hour before we headed home, once again I got approached by a security guard this time a male. He came over and said ""are you a member?"" I said ""yes I'm a member of the accor hotels"" he then replied ""are you staying at the hotel tonight"" I stated that we checked out that morning and we're getting our luggage, we were just relaxing before we head home.","Following on from the top paragraph box - In which he was very rude and commented back ""so you aren't staying in the hotel tonight"" I had already told him no! I was shocked and quite frankly embarrassed the way we were treated by two security guards and a few members of staff! Absolutely shocking!! We first came to this hotel when it was brand new and just opened, it was amazing but now it seems like you have employed the most arrogant security guards who do not care about the guests! In which case is very bad as this will stop a lot of your loyal guests from coming back! I am also extremely angry as when we got our suitcase back the handle had broken, this wasn't the case when we handed it in to be stored safely for the day? (I'm happy to send pictures) The only thing we could think of is if someone had forced the suitcase handle down causing it to break, not realizing you need to hold a button in for it to go down? I understand this is awkward however surely if you're looking after guests luggage the staff would be more careful and not force or break the luggage! This wasn't exactly a cheap suitcase so my partner and I are more than just a little angry in regards to this situation. I am very sad that I have had to write this sort of review as I was expecting to write a brilliant one as always. All in all the Executive Suite was very beautiful, well laid out and spotless. Our room was amazing which made our stay just that little bit better. I would like to thank the staff that sorted out our room, and also gave us the little treats and birthday card it was a lovely gesture. I just cannot put into anymore words how extremely disappointed and upset we are in regards to the issues caused.",8.3

Also I know it is a la Carte but the restaurant menu wasn’t very varied it didn’t have much for people who only eat chicken or are vegetarian, so we had to leave and go up to the bar for food instead.

She was very abrupt, dismissive & had a lot of attitude which you wouldn’t expect from a supervisor. Whereas “Verno or Verca” not sure what his name was sooo understanding, welcoming & polite. He really was ready to help & assist.
The story behind my feedback is, it was my birthday, so in advance I contacted hotel directly over the phone & asked if it will be possible to get an early check in. Now normally people are asking for upgrades, beautiful view etc. However for myself, it was different. The man over the phone said that it will be fine & that I should come at 1pm instead of 3pm.
But he did mention to call that same morning to confirm it was still okay.
Now I did exactly that, I called 10am on the day & he was same person I spoke to prior who now confirmed it was still okay to come at 1pm.
Now I got there at 2pm & I’m was now being told that it’s not possible. And that they’ll work on something. Which I was fine with, however what I was disappointed with, was the fact that the booking doesn’t state that I need to make a deposit on top of payment of my room upon arrival.
Anyway, I was willing to pay but I explained to both Ines & gentleman that that it’s not in booking & they agreed booking.com don’t say it but it’s their rule and I made them aware of how misleading it was & they agreed.
Anyway, moving forward I ask to pay by cash for deposit even though I managed to pay with my card for room but that was due to sufficient on the card. “Verna or Verco” can’t remember his name, said that was fine he went to get document I needed to sign then all I hear is Ines shouting walking out saying “no no no noooo!! We don’t take cash & Verna/Verco asking why? It’s fine. She paid with card for room, we can take cash. And Ines shouting no, cash! Card only!",8.3

Breakfast was included and was delicious and the staff made an effort to give us the best view of London whenever they could (room and breakfast table). The roof top bar is amazing and drinks were very reasonable. The staff went the extra mile the whole stay and when we asked to check in early, they told us that they were happy for us to do so but recommended us to wait for the room they had selected and this was well worth the wait. The views of Canary Wharf, London eye, the shard etc were amazing. We will definitely be returning.

We asked other guests at breakfast and everyone had the same complaint. The building quality is too cheap and not fit for purpose. V disappointing

Some conditioner in the room would have been nice to accompany the shampoo and accessible water in the pool area along with some more lounge type seating (there were just the two swing seats so no one else knew where to put towels or where to sit if they werent in the pool) would have made it a little more comfortable but all in all a good stay.

The reception staff is friendly and the breakfast on the 38th floor has a very nice view.,We arrived in the morning and were told the room is ready but £30 extra for an early check in which we didn’t do it. So we went out and came back at night around 11pm. Checked in and when I went to use the bathroom noticed that there were a clump of hair on the towel. There were also blood stain and body hair on the bed too. I immediately called the housekeeping and the woman on the phone seemed doesn’t understand me. I waited for 15mins no one came up so I had to call the reception asking for the person who was in charge. I then got speak to this gentleman. After I showed him the hair he explained that the hair on the towel was unacceptable that they will definitely investigate however the hair on the bed looks like the hair from someone’s arm. He asked me what he could do for me and I asked for another room which he told me “the hotel was full” without even checking or thinking. He did offer me new towel and asked if I need the bed sheet changed but at 11:30pm I just couldn’t wait any longer after spending all day out!!,6.2

1119,Kyle,United Kingdom,Superior Double Room,1 night ·  May 2019,Couple,Reviewed: 27 May 2019,Shocking!!,The view that’s about it.,"Firstly when checking in we was rushed through check in to be told our room wasn’t ready anyway. We finally got to our room that night & realised the lamp next to the bed was broken so we had to have the lights on that were next to the pillows. When waking up in the morning to start the day off with a coffee we found out that the kettle was broken. I called front desk to tell them could they fix it and they said “we will send someone up”....... 30 minutes later after patiently waiting I then called again to ask what was the hold up & the reply was “ohhh have they not been yet, I will call the team to find out what the hold up is” we then again waited another 5 minutes still no knock on the door. Frustrated with the hold up I called again & had to actually ask if it was possible to get 2 coffees? Not even an offer from staff it’s like they didn’t even care (still no maintenance team on hand) finally the coffee arrived after a 45 minutes and it was literally the size of a shot of espresso (latte was requested) really wasn’t worth it. Just to top it all off I’ve arrived home today & checked my bank account for payments made & they have taken £150 out. I pre paid for the room back in April to get it cheaper then to see £150 taken out for “pre authorisation” which we didn’t know about or get told about before agreeing at check in. I had to find this out by calling the hotel to then yet again wait for a hour to get a email for reasons why and they said apparently it was only meant to be £100 & the extra £50 was “a glitch in the system” so now I have to wait 3-5 days for a refund. No phone call back to apologies just a email for me to go off & wait for my refund. Utterly shocking service for what I thought was a respectable hotel chain.

However we quickly located the button for the smart glass which turns the pane of glass from clear to frosted, which I loved. This button wasn't labelled though which I think would be something for the hotel to follow up on. Bar was lovely and welcoming but at £23 a round (two cocktails plus 12.5% service charge) we only stayed for one. That said it is London and we weren't expecting it to be cheap. The hotel also held our bags free of charge for the day after we checked out.","We had room 1801, which is a corner room, and looking at the floor plan diagram is smaller than the other rooms on the floor, I guess it's luck of the draw but a bit crap that you can pay the same for a smaller room and a larger room.",9.6

The modern room was really nice, great city view and the bathroom was clean as we entered. Bedsheets were clean and we slept comfortably well. Reception was quick to pick up and very pleasant receptionists. We enjoyed the use of the pool so thank you for that. 
Staff were excellent and very accomodating which we were thankful for. They were very welcoming and hospitable. Keep up the good work! Otherwise, thank you very much for having us.","Well, considering it's covid I understand that staff have their own rules to follow and made new restrictions in giving assistance. One of the changes was they do not do room service so we had to stack used towels and floor mats somewhere for 2 nights and the bins both in the bathroom and outside were full up so it was quite a mess. 
We requested to have a room service as we had dinner outside but I was told it wasn't possible due to covid restrictions which didn't quite make sense to me since they would have cleaned the room when we check out regardless.
I understand that the pandemic made it extra difficult to fulfill these things but I really believe something needs to be done in this area of concern one way or another as it ends up smelling and looking unpleasant which can be uncomfortable for guests.",7.0

De kamers zijn super. Ruim. proper en een mooie badkamer. 
In de buurt van het hotel is een metrostation en dus is alles in Londen vlot te bereiken. Wij hebben ook een groot deel te voet gedaan, is wel een eindje stappen, maar goed te doen. (voor een groot deel langs de Theems naar Tower bridge en van daaruit te voet naar Big Ben en Londen Eye).",,9.6

Venus en couple, nous avons eu droit à une attention très personnalisée de la part du personnel pour notre lune de miel. Les chambres sont impeccables (propreté, salle de bain, équipements, très grand écran plat...), et la vue que nous avions était incroyable. Le personnel est très à l'écoute et sait satisfaire sa clientèle, nous avons beaucoup apprécié.
Le salle de petit déjeuner au 38ème étage vaut le détour, d'autant que le petit déjeuner est très complet : confitures, miel, tous types de pain, muffins, viennoiseries, tout y était. 
En semaine, la clientèle est surtout une clientèle en voyage d'affaire. Nous avons donc pu profiter du spa, piscine hammam et salle de sport où nous étions seuls, il y avait par contre un peu plus de monde le week-end.
Nous étions un peu hésitants sur le quartier, mais il est vraiment super! Il s'agit en fait d'un quartier d'affaires avec des buildings, plein de vie en semaine et très reposant le week-end, à quelques dizaines de minutes du centre de Londres en métro (nous étions venus pour visiter la ville).
