       "9   TV had no working channels due to expose cable wire from connector which I had to push in. TV remote is useless in room 925. I don't know about other rooms. Fashion is low. For location I was really expecting something more worthy. Set the heating to 26° but all night I been shivering until I turned it off. I wish I could get back my money. I'd feel better sleeping in the car for the night. I've been to lower class hotels before but atleast they had usb plug sockets, here there was none. Its nothing compared to the images. And that car park really need some work done. I had to pay £20+ to park under that broken looking space. You get 2x20 minutes free on WiFi then you have to pay. Not the cleanest. Carpets are old and obvious.   \n",
