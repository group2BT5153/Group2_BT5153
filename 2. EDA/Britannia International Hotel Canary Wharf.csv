The shower. Cheap but nice an warm","TV had no working channels due to expose cable wire from connector which I had to push in. TV remote is useless in room 925. I don't know about other rooms.

It is one of the cheaper hotels in the area and I believe it was good value for money. The breakfast room and bar are both level with the water and have a great view while eating.
While some may see the decor as dated and carpets a bit worn, I really like the period feel, It is definitely not modern and has a very eighties feel, and I appreciated that it was something different and unique - pleasant change.
The room was well sound insulated and I slept very well both nights.","The hotel does seem to be looking for extra revenue streams - it seems ridiculous that a 4 star hotel should charge GBP7 per night for WIFI (the free 20 in was really fast though)
Breakfast was not very good and not much selection - definitely not worth the GBP15. The fruit came out of a can and the jam was still in the shape of its can; eggs were pre-fried, and sausages and bacon were hard. There is a discount if you buy breakfast on checkin, which means you are locked in before you see the breakfast - rather skip this and try one of the restaurants or coffee shops near by.
Checkin was very slow. And the concierge desk was not manned when I returned to collect my luggage after checkout.

It's an unusual property because it's comparatively old so the chandeliers are lovely, the art deco artefacts and statues and the polished brass detail. When first built in the 60s or 70s it would have been way ahead of its time in terms of quality and spaciousness. The rooms on the higher floors are a good 55m2 with a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The staff, especially the concierge and duty managers are all highly efficient, as indeed is the housekeeping.","The beautiful spa facilities which included sauna, steam room, gym and swimming pool was ripped out about two years ago to make way for 100 odd more windowless rooms. The spa was an attractive feature of this hotel, but money rules and rooms make more than spas. The Indian restaurant was closed years ago, it was a good one, so what's left is now ""tourist"" restaurants with menus to match. The hotel caters for large bus groups from up North and the continent. If you like greasy English breakfasts buffet style, then this is for you. We don't eat in any of the restaurants in this hotel because the food is not up to standard. The elevators are so old, slow and creaky they sometimes break down. It's about time the owner replaced them, because the trip down from the 13, 12, or 11 Floors can sometimes be a little alarming.

When you approached anyone,even security it was like you were inconvenient to them!! The tubes were all cashless, nightmare to get tickets. I asked at reception, about transport not much help, or information given. I had asked for early check in, when booking, as I was arriving early at 10am. And when got there reception, said that it wasn’t on the system, so had to hang around till 2pm in lobby for room. Couldn’t get a bite to eat till 12 noon. I had stated when booking, I was paying by cash, I got there to pay they said extra £100deposit if I was paying by cash. Queues were so long to check in. I booked the room, it had no window in room the receptionist, kept pointing out more or less every time I approached the desk. my room had no window.

Aswell as this, DO NOT PAY WITH CASH. There was no prior warning to the £50 deposit fee that I would have to pay if I wanted to pay for my room in cash. This should have been clarified on the booking.com website which it was not.

631,Flavia,Italy,Standard Double Room without Window,3 nights ·  October 2019,Group,"Reviewed: October 15, 2019","Great location, beautiful hotel, but staff wasn't always helpful","The location is great, you are in the heart of London and you can get to the city centre in 20 minutes tube ride. Canary Wharf is one of the newest area in London and it's great to explore by foot. The hotel is actually very nice, the lobby is very big and spacious. Overall, the hotel is beautiful and at night all lightened up, it's quite a scene.","The description of the room on the booking.com website was misleading. We opted for the room without the window, but there was no explanation that the room was actually underneath the ground floor (bear in mind that there are 12 floors). Unfortunately, my friend had some panic attacks during the night due to the lack of air. When we went to the reception to explain what was going on, they were not helpful at all. They said that at midnight there was no house keeping around and so we could not change the room. How come a 4 stars hotel has no housekeeping at night? They did not even try to help or to understand, they categorly said no without really trying. It was quite an emergency, but they did not seem to care. We had to wait the next day to change room. We asked for two pillows to help my friend sleep and we had to wait 40 minutes. There was no communication withint the receptionists, every single time we had to explain the issue. Eventually, we managed to change the room, but until the end, we did not know which was the room number. In order to avoid this issue again, I would suggest to organise the staff differently to be able to have a room ready at night if necessary. There should always be someone for house keeping 24/7. It was a very serious reason, something should have been done immediately. This caused a lot of discomfort to my friend and made us feel uncomfortable.",7.1

On booking i emailed the hotel twice but had no reply. On arrival there was a little wait to check in which was only a problem as I had walked 9 miles and had blisters, there was no where to sit and wait. Checking in itself was quick and efficient, staff member was friendly. Had to wait a while for the lift, got to my room only to find the key didn't work. I was tired and aching so that didn't go down well, a member of staff walked by and when i told him i was informed i had to go back to reception to get it changed. Waited ages for the lift again. Got to reception and definitely wasn't joining the back of the queue so went to reception desk and tried to get someones attention but was completely ignored, not happy now!! Fortunately the member of staff who served me handed me another key as soon as he had the opportunity. Once in the room, i felt good, nice room, lovely view and a tempting jacuzzi. Water was very slow to fill but that gave me a chance to have a cuppa and sit looking at the view. Jacuzzi worked but noisy and not very powerful, was good to be able to soak though. Bathroom furniture is a bit dated and could definitely do with an upgrade but was sufficient. Bed was too hard for me but for those that don't mind a firm bed you should be ok, I just had to be a bit inventive and as it was warm in the room I folded the quilt and slept on that with the sheet over me. Would probably go elsewhere next time as for me the bed is the dealbreaker, otherwise I would return.",Not ignored by a member of staff and the bed could have been softer for my liking.

It is not that the staff are not pleasant, but there are too few of them. Bar is well served though. Worst of all though was the 20 minute window of free WiFi.

So I eventually booked a room with a double bed but actually got a room with two single bed pushed together. Now imagine trying to cuddle someone and the single beds on wheels split apart under you like plate tectonics. It was not at all pleasant.
The room was old and has sockets that I have never seen before, all over. And they can't be regular sockets because my universal adptor failed to adapt! It took me a good 10 minutes to find a socket from modern society I could use to charge my phone and that was hidden behind furniture. Then there was this complicated internet setup that had to be paid extra and stopped working on multiple occassions. 
I stayed for 2 nights in the hotel and after my first night I only left my room at around 1 pm. At that time the maids were still cleaning as I saw the vacuum cleaner in the corridor. To my surprise when I came back later that night my room was not cleaned.

Fittings starting to come away from the walls already (cheapest of the cheap used), desk/table in room must have cost at best £20, wobbled from side to side.
Room was underground, didn't bother me but might some.
Internet access a WHOPPING £7 per device, utter rip off.
Overall a hotel that has huge potential to be amazing, but owners or site management don't have a 'team' of workers, just independent misery gut workers who don't even nod to each other. Very sad, I'd hate to work there.
Oh, and parking is a mighty £25 per night too.
Owner: I know you own Pontins etc but this site, a prime location, get a great GM on board and pay him/her well, let him/her choose their own AM and DMs and give them cart blanche on local decisions within budget, and you will have an amazing hotel within a year.",6.7

The wifi is only free in the public areas and in your room you get 20 miss free. After that you need to pay for it.

I loved the fact that I didn’t have to give my name when I checked in and greeted with a welcome back and small talk about things I had mentioned in my previous trips. The international isn’t modern in anyway and this really added to its charm and character.,All of the things I loved about this hotel seemed to have changed on this visit. I still got my lovely receptionist who knew me and the cheeky bar staff who also recognise me but the moment I had to deal with a new receptionist I was made to feel unimportant which is generally how most big hotels in London can make you feel but the reason I go without free WiFi or free parking or more modern facilities etc is because the international was so welcoming. I booked as usual using booking.com as I do for all of my stays and as I had paid extra to upgrade the day before I selected the upgrade option on the site. I was told that the room I was in was a suite which having stayed in many hotels I find it hard to believe but took this information on board. The receptionist quite rightly asked her manager about the upgrade which I had purchased and although it was honoured the way I was treated has left a sour taste. Now instead of staying a further 4 more days buying food drinks etc with my family at the hotel we will be checking out and moving to one of the brighter more modern hotels in Canary Wharf area.,6.2

Firstly as I checked in I was told I needed photo ID which is something I’ve only ever been asked and would expect if I was abroad. I told her I didn’t have it as didn’t expect to need it, she explained that it’s in the booking details. I did feel extremely embarrassed as the queue of people behind me could definitely here this conversation. The receptionist said she would over look it this time but next time remember to bring it. 
She asked me if I wanted a window which I replied yes some kind of view would be nice and I was charged £20 for it. She said she’d given me a view of the river. When we got to our room we found that the view was of the quay and two building sites (the quay isn’t the river, that was on the other side of the hotel). 
The room is very dated, with no sockets by the bed. 
The bathroom was very tired and we did find the tap over the sink was leaking, even though there is a bath mat it isn’t long enough for the bath and became a little slippery, there was even a small cobweb in the top right hand corner above the sink, very disappointing. 
Even as we checked out we wasn’t even asked if we had a nice stay.

Nothing has changed since I worked in the hotel back in 1995 - a great trip down memory lane being back at Canary Wharf.
Reasonable parking charges for a location so close to central London. Really easy to find, a little roadworks to negotiate but well mapped out and on Waze sat nav with precise location.
Easy check-in at reception - no complicated form filling all done from electronic online booking and simple checkout post-box.
Spacious rooms with lots of storage for long stays. Fully equipped with tea/coffee, iron, toiletries etc. We booked a ""room with no view"" as we were on a budget and for just one night we did not need views etc, but found our room to have a window and view of the hotel front which was a pleasant surprise.
We ate in the lounge bar from the pizzeria - reasonably priced in comparison to what you would pay at a take-away and cheaper than the major chain pizza restaurants.
Bar staff were friendly, efficient and helpful. Reasonably priced wine list, staff were knowledgeable and advised accordingly.","The rooms are very dated (refurb in the two bedrooms we booked required) and there was a very ""funky"" smell in both rooms. The corridor by the lifts had a very pungent smell as if someone had been smoking something not bought over the counter in a tobacconist.
Fridays closed very early but there was the main bar of the hotel that was open until 1am, however several of the clientele asked both myself and my 17 year old daughter if we were escorts, then when my nephew arrived he was asked by a third person how much for me and my daughter! There was blatant prostitution going on in the bar area from 10pm until midnight, there was one lady who approached half a dozen men disappearing with each for 20 mins or so at a time. Not a comfortable environment for lone female guests to sit.
Although entertaining it's not a venue I would rebook through choice. It suited my stay for a business event close by on the Saturday but i'm certainly glad I was not alone there. I would not recommend for families or women travelling alone, nor would I pay over £50 per night for the facilities as they are. 
It's not all about location location - the hotel needs to clean up the issues in the bar with the few ladies touting for business, and refurb the rooms.",5.8

This is a curious hotel to find in an area of spanking new glass and concrete tower blocks. Shabby to an almost comical extent (e.g. splits in upholstery fabric, insulating tape presumably masking a cut on a sofa in the lobby), but our room was really spacious for London, especially at the price, and the unfashionable bathroom with shower curtain over bath was perfectly clean and worked. We'd asked for a room high up with a view, and got one on the fourth floor, at the back, overlooking a building site. But it was very quiet, and the cotton bedlinen made for a comfortable night. When the lifts failed, there was an alternative, presumably mainly used by staff. Overall, the place has the feeling of being patched up and waiting for something to happen to it.

1903,Jerry,United Kingdom,Standard Double Room,7 nights ·  January 2019,Couple,"Reviewed: January 16, 2019","Very Poor, the first thing we did once in our room was to cancel another booking we'd made for Feb","They had a decent selection for breakfast, though food was fairly tasteless. The 24 hour restaurant food was good quality & cooked nicely, though pricey.","A wonderful place to stay maybe, back in about 1995. My advice to you now is to AVOID and be prepared to cough up a couple of hundred quid a week more & stay else-where locally.
Our week's stay got off to a poor start with a stroppy receptionist who wouldn't book us in unless we had a Booking.com reference number. We'd never been asked for this anywhere else & after making this clear she pulled out a card with our name on it. She then rejected our credit card saying we couldn't use it (Bank of Scotland) and we'd have to offer another, despite the fact the hotel had deducted £90 from the same card the day prior to our arrival.
The room was a disgrace, see attched images. Its an insult to Canary Wharf.
Upon entering we noticed the carpet loose; enough to peel it back with the toe of your shoe. It was also very old and frayed. The wardrobe was a joke. The hangers they supply inside it are about an inch too wide for the space, resulting in them hanging at an angle off the rail. The wardrobes are cheap mirror doors in tracks, so if you remove a garment from the hanger & straighten the hanger in the process, it forces the door away & out of its track. The doors were almost impossible to slide, unless you spent time re-fixing them. The bathroom door was worn and lacked varnish. The bath towels were almost too small to go round the waist of even a slim male like myself. At least there was decent water pressure & plenty of hot water.
The table lampshades were damaged, excessively so & unsightly. The bedside cabinets were old with glass tops to protect them, however, the glass had over time scored tears in the wallpaper. There was scribble on one wall extending to around 5 to 6 feet.
The lift was shaky & squeaked going down & the noise of the squeak transmitted itself along the ducting to our room, to the point of waking us, often.",5.4

Had to go down to reception to tell them and we waited for half an hour in a room with no power to be upgraded to a different room. I left my jacket in the previous room by accident and only realised that night when it was quite late, so thought I would just ask reception in the morning. Next morning at 10am we go down to reception and everyone is confused and thinks we've checked out and then in again. I have to tell the story about 3 or 4 more times till they get it and they can't find my jacket. Manager assures me that when we get back at the end of the day that my jacket will be there. We come back that evening and no one even knows about my jacket being missing. I'm so angry at this point and the new manager that was working assures me that I'll have my jacket in the morning. I told him NO, as his colleague from this morning said the same thing. He had to make some phone calls to actually get into the lost and found area and we waited for another half an hour before he came back and told me it was logged in the log back that there was a jacket found in our previous room. I got it first thing the next morning. It took about 7 staff members and 2 days to locate my jacket even though I told them exactly where I left it in the room.

The curtains were dated and cheap and tacky looking. The dark brown furniture also looked dated and grubby. I all, the whole hotel had a shabby and dated look.

Great location, although a little boat taking people backs and forths to the main square and the hotel would be nice. Hotel looks closer to the foot bridge then it actually is. There was a lot of building works when I visited, so hopefully there will be a footpath along the dock.
The room was big and very well equipped. Although it was next to a building site. We had two single beds, but the size of the single bed was too narrow and uncomfortable - specially for large people or pregnant women. I basically did not sleep and the next day was wasted as I was too tired and kept sitting around rather than sightseeing London. 
Female check in lady allocated us a room away from a group of horrible men from Portugal.
Cleaning lady gave extra soap and towel when I asked and she offered her help should I needed it.","Male hotel staff - whilst I was queuing to check in, some male Portuguese men started cutting the queue. There was a lot of people waiting to check in. After I told them that they were being rude for cutting the queue, an old Portuguese man shouted across the lobby to the other group of men misogynistic comments, followed by loud laughs from the male group by the check in desk. I am fluent in Portuguese so I raised my voice in English telling him to not speak like that about women. None of the hotel staff intervened to move the men nor to reprimand their behaviour. There were only 2 female staff by the check in desk but there were 2 male staff just watching, standing by the concierge desk. None of them offered to help the other 2 female colleagues to help with checking in guests.
That incident was the thing which most distressed me about the hotel. Although the hotel is not culpable for guest behaviour, the hotel lacked good managerial skills to organise enough staff or a dedicated desk to large groups checking in. There was also no hotel security in sight to move the old man shouting insults at me away from the lobby are.
Male bar staff were also extremely rude in their manner of serving and the bar stunk. Seats by the windows were mended with tape - which is bizarre, given that the hotel could easily get a free sofa on Olio or Freecycle.
The single bed was way too narrow for a pregnant woman and I could not sleep.
There is only one small lift for the entire hotel, which is for guests and staff. So bear this in mind if you have to rush for appointments/flights/trains, etc.
The hotel employs mainly foreign staff and by nature, foreign people living in the UK will be less assertive and avoid conflict. The main fault seems to be with management with regards to the significant difference on professionalism by female versus male hotel staff. I observed female staff constantly at work and I observed male staff constantly killing time or being unprofessional.",5.8

The air-con was maintining the room in freezing condition.
And the first night, at 1.20 am, I have been awakened by a man beating his girlfriend so hard that I had to call the desk to stop it. The police came, the man went into prison. The whole thing took one hour to settle down and was completely terrifying. But the folowing days of my stay, I didn't receive any notice from the hotel that they were sorry about it, nor did they give me any discount for the inconvenience and fright I had been submited to when I aske for it during the check-out. Their excuse - explained the charming young man who was supposed to be sort of a manager but who did not have any business card to prove it - was that Booking.com did not allow the hotel to conceed any discount, even after such a disaster night... Would I not have asked, they simply would never have mentioned anything to me about about this traumatic event, which I found rather extraordinay knowing that I was the one giving the alert. The violence in the room next door was such that I thought this couple would break the wall and fall into my room ! No really, this is not a correct way to treat clients !",7.9

The concierge was extremely rude and really went to great lengths to be sarcastic and unpleasant throughout this whole process (4 star international hotel doing this, if I managed this hotel I would sack the man on the spot for the way he behaved) he consistently indicated that he felt it was reasonable that they failed to keep to the advertised schedule. On the ticket it says if you leave the cleaning before 8am in the morning it will be ready by 6pm. It wasn't available until the following evening and even then there was a lot of delay, lots of implication that I was still being unreasonably hasty even on the evening of the following the early morning drop off, and implication that I had left the cleaning later than I actually had without any checking the facts etc. The price is also extremely high. At the Ibis I pay about £7 for much better service, here it is £14.

İ would like to point to several points I noted there 
1-I saw a small mouse in my room twice late at night wandering between the beds and my luggage, I was really scarred and terrified
2- I have seen a trap but behind the curtain of my window which obviously was build to get this kind of rats , mice or crawling creatures , it reflects in my opinion that they are used to this kind of animals
3- the rooms were dirty full of dust and had a very bad odour , the carpets were in very poor condition and full of dust 
4- I booked a room with a view instead they gave me a room far away from a nice view and very close to ongoing maintenance , that i have to sleep in very noisy environment the whole day 
5- I suffered a lot getting a nap surrounded by mice , dust and noise 
6- I aslo booked a room with double large bed instead they gave me a small room with two small separate bed to sleep !!!
7-there were no available room service or even reception service all the team to call for help or assistance 
8-the TV screen was not working properly as the remote control was not working and not matching the TV brand !!! 
9-there were very few drinks left in the room to use 
10- there were very little samples of soap and shampoo left in the bathroom obviously it was really annoying to find a very small piece of soap or very Ting bottle of shampoo to use 
11- I found a label in my room by the hotel staff asking their guests not to leave their valuables at the rooms , I really felt unsafe to leave my watch in the room or my luggage or laptop
Mainly I don't recommend this hotel to any one",1.0

Beds a bit lumpy and pillows could be more plump if I'm being honest but at £48 you get what you pay for. Was a good 101/15 min walk to local tube. Didnt have breakfast as didnt notice any gluten free options on menu in room. TV would of been better on wall as when your in bed was hard to see over feet.

I am British, and I have been traveling around the UK for decades. I have never before been asked for photo ID as a condition of checking in: a process that took over 10 minutes!

The experience was a bit like how I should imagine a stay in Guantanamo bay would be like, but much more expensive! The room was tired. Finding it was also a challenge as there are corridors for even and odd numbered rooms. After spending 5 mins looking for my odd numbered room in the even numbered corridor, I had to return to Reception to have what should have been explained to me at the lengthy check-in explained to me!!

The gold chandeliers and green couches in the lobby were elegant, during the day the area was ok, it's in the financial district, so the nearest station, Canary Warf, is huge with nice shops and restaurants for the business people who work in the area. All of that is closed at night. The bed room was large with room to move around and keep luggage for a longer stay.","Do not get the breakfast! The wifi isn't free! The staff was all young and seemed to not want to be there. There was a lot of construction in the area when we were there, so it was loud, and at night, we couldn't walk directly from the train station to the hotel because the sidewalks were closed. I'm sure that's why we got a good deal on the price. 
Because it cost less, the clientele was a mixed bag, as a woman, I wouldn't have wanted to stay by myself. Back to the breakfast - it is a buffet style of motel style food in a dusty old ballroom. Not my vibe. Don't get talked into buying the breakfast vouchers when you check it. If you value quality food at all, it's worth it to walk around the corner to one of the restaurants for breakfast. 
Also, when I checked in, I was told the wifi in the lobby was free, but in the rooms, we only got 40 minutes a day. That was not explained ahead of time. As an American with my own business, I have to be able to check in, and I booked hotels with wifi so that I could work in the mornings. I found out, after going up to the room that you only get 20 minutes every 24 hours and then it cuts you off and asks you to pay. 
Was it comfortable enough and priced well for the location? Sure. Was it a great experience? No.

The overworked bar staff were excellent.,Had to wait in a queue for an hour to check in then had a receptionist that could not understand us and was most unhelpful which made us late for the event we were going to. The room 167 was located in a terrible position opposite the chamber maids room so we were woken after a few hours sleep by the staff getting there trolleys etc. We had only a short sleep due to constant noise from what sounded like a giant washing machine going all night. The view from the window was of a building site which we discovered when they began work at 7am driving a noisy truck up and down. We had no information in the room or given to us about any facilities or even how to work the television. Thankfully we are intelligent enough to find our way around an hotel. another quest told us how to get to the tube station.,4.6

We had to pay for parking which was not an outrageous price but I think should of been free with the stay. On the parking, it was very cramped and hard to drive around , small and filled with random stuff on the sides like carpets and fire extinguishers that we were trying not to hit while trying to simply get out of the cramped underground space. I will definitely go to London again but I would not stay in this hotel again and I would not recommend it.",2.0

The pizza restaurant in the lobby was open till the late hours which meant there was somewhere affordable to eat when most of the food places in Canary Wharf had closed.","The bedding was quite aged, it was clearly in need of replacement.

The score is a 3.3, calculated by the system!!!","The size of the bath in the suite we got upgraded to after a mouse fell from the gaping hole in the ceiling from water damage, and that it had jets","Upon arrival the reception could not find our booking and was a little rude, however the booking was found and sorted rather quickly. As we wondered around the labyrinth that is the Britannia International Hotel (Canary Warf) with rather poor directions, I came across water damage and a hole in the ceiling right by our room. I went to find my wife (still wondering around trying to find our room) as I walked back towards our room I heard scurrying in the ceiling, I looked up at the gaping hole caused by the water damage only to see two mice, one of which fell out onto the floor and ran into room 167 (there is a CCTV camera that will show you the incident). Our room was substandard and after complaining (and mentioning the mice) we were offered an upgrade. When being upgraded and moved from our room the concierge seemed unfazed, although apologetic and helpful, by the fact there are mice in a hotel (which has a restaurant downstairs, I'm sure this is a health and safety issue?). In the suite we were upgraded to there was a lovely little humane mouse trap under our bed (clearly an ongoing issue with mice) the bed was comfortable enough (on tiny wheels and seeming to be two bases pushed together to make one bed), the pillows were ok at best. The rooms and hotel as a whole need small upgrades wherever you look (wallpaper, burnt furniture needs to be removed or refurbished, tiny TV's in a large room, that kind of thing). When we decided to head out to eat (obviously no chance we were eating a thing in the hotel) there were trays of used crockery, glasses, wine bottles and a bin left out in the open on the floor (another possible health and safety issue here?).
Needless to say; our short stay at this hotel was nothing short of an expensive catastrophe.",3.3
3730,Adriana,Portugal,Standard Double Room,4 nights ·  September 2019,Group,"Reviewed: October 4, 2019","Horrible mattress, wi-fi, staff, and hotel food. No way going back!",The location.,"One of the worst hotel experiences ever. I reserved based on the decent reviews on Bookings, and it was awful. The staff at the desk could not speak English, they would request you sign papers and yet have no idea what they are handing to you. So resolving anything was a headache and at least an hour wait, as other guests were complaining about the hotel.
The wi-fi, is not free in the rooms, unless you are down in the lobby. Which looks like a fraternity full of high school kids, absolutely no class for a lobby, as everyone is in pjs in the lobby making use of free wi-fi, and quite uncomfortable and noisy. The paid wi-fi also goes on and off in the room, and it is 7£ pounds per device. It is terrible wi-fi even paying it, and the staff doesn't really care when mentioning it. The hotel makes money on extras, wi-fi, parking, even you leave a few minutes late, anything... they will charge. It isn't clear until you get into the lobby and see their signs here and there with extra costs for all types of things. So if you think you are saving on a lower cost room, you really aren't.
In addition to the horrible staff service, the bed mattress had every spring in it hit your back and crack as you move to try to find a position on it. I had reported that the mattress was not at all in sleeping condition, their reply, "" they're quite new mattresses, "" and i asked the supervisor to please check mattress to see for himself. Not a little dent, the whole thing was shot!
First day I arrived late from flight, went to buy two club sandwiches for me and my friend at the hotel restaurant. I paid 28£ pounds, hoping they'd be decent sandwiches. The chicken was so dry and old. The bread was awful. My friend didn't even eat it. So we ended up a night with barely anything to eat, and from there on in, went outside of the hotel to eat.
Never again going back. And I would expect a friendlier or courteous service given the mattress was horrible.",1.0

3792,Philippa,Australia,Standard Double Room,7 nights ·  September 2019,Couple,"Reviewed: September 25, 2019",This hotel is definitely in need of refurbishment.,"Believe me when I say I try to find the positives in hotels. It was hard with this place. We stayed for 7 days. We only stayed here, as the hotel we were booked into cancelled about 9 days before our intended stay. 
Daily happy hour from 4-6!
The black out curtains - because they work!
We did manage to find a laundrette in the area which saved us money rather than use the exorbitant charges the hotel would have charged to wash socks, undies and hankies. Thank you google!","The position - it’s listed as 600m from Canary Wharf Station it’s more likely over a kilometre - over due to construction work in the area, terrain that is difficult for dragging suitcases. And due to construction the view out of the window is nonexistent. 
The bed - most uncomfortable bed I’ve slept in at a hotel in 30 years. 
The pillows - so flat you need two of them. 
No spare powerpoint close to the bed. So if you need to use a CPAP machine you will need to rearrange their lamps or bring an extension cord. 
The shower over the bath - if you are mobility challenged it is impossible to get in and out by yourself. 
The tiny towels - most international hotels these days use large bath towels for drying yourself with,this place only uses the small ones. 
The tiny tablets of soap - if you want to wash yourself bring your own standard soap. Plus the shampoo they supply is useless. They also don’t leave a face washer in the room, which makes it hard to use the body wash they supply. 
There is no fridge in the room so you can’t keep a drink or anything else cold in your room. 
The cleaning staff, while they did make the bed, we had to hide the almost empty roll of toilet paper, so they would leave us some the next day. How hard is it to leave a spare roll when there is only one on the holder? 
The lifts are in need of a service. We were on the 10th floor. One day it took 7 minutes in the lift to get to the ground. They are very slow, stop at floors that aren’t selected and often only 2 out 3 were working. 
The temperature of the room - you can adjust it, you can only turn the fan up, so the room got very stuffy.",3.3

I must say my first impression of the hotel was ruined on the first day itself. I would not say that don't visit this hotel but booking.com should carefully evaluate the facilities before they confirm the booking.
Also, breakfast was charged at 11 GBP, but it was not worth having it. I had a breakfast twice but both the days there was a same menu and very boring.

- it was a single bed room instead of a double standard, as said and per my booking
- it smelled strongly of fresh paint and chemicals
- the carpet was partially dirty with some white powder, probably from the renovations
- the shower was defective, probably from installation
- that part of the hotel was so deep down that mobile connectivity was impossible
- as said, there was no phone in the room , so I had a clear impression of being isolated
- it was in a recently renovated basement, so also the corridors were still smelling of fresh paint

Broken elevators 2 of 3 elevators were out of service leaving 1 working for people with multiple cases to queue for or having to climb the stairs, I had to climb to the 7th floor (14 flights). There were no staff available to assist people. My room (736) was very dated, scrapes & gouges out of the wall paper & plaster, bathroom floor tiles not meeting the carpet divider, very cheap toilet paper. We didn’t want to open the curtains as there was major buildings work going on across the alleyway & we were overlooked by numerous builders going about there trades. 
The builders were all able to use the hotels facilities & at each shift change the bar & lounge area was frequented by many of them downing a few pints. They even sat in the foyer in the breaks. 
At least Breakfast was edible & to an extent enjoyable, The waiting staff on duty didn’t do a great deal, they didn’t serve but had a plastic bucket on view as you entered the restaurant for tips? The breakfast was all self service including coffee machines, staff were immaculately dressed to clear tables once you were finished, so how can they expect tips? 
Overall my stay was very disappointing especially for the £120 overnight price & I wouldn’t recommend to any of my fellow travellers, as my title says, I’ve had a better service & stay at premier inn & for a fraction of the price.

The English restaurant did not have great choices and it's where we had to have breakfast and that was nothing to rave about.

The electrical appliances have undated test certificates - if any at all. Ironing board covered in black streaks and unusable. The iron was stained black too. Carpets filthy. Big Queues at check in due to every single person ahead of me complaining about hidden extras, obscure rules, foul smells, poor food, invalid vouchers. The ‘would you like upgrade to a room with a window’ gag was tried on everyone that checked in for the 20 minutes my process took. Some said yes and were charged extra. Those who said no were then ‘upgraded as our gift to you’. It’s all a con. There probably aren’t any rooms with no window. Read the Ts and Cs and be aware before you book - they are obscure and used to trap you. There is a reason why a 4 star hotel has a no cancellation policy - it’s because everyone tries to cancel when they see what they booked. When a supposed 4 star hotel is available on the heart of Canary Wharf for an unbelievably low price, and all around are at least double the price, it should ring alarm bells. If it looks too good to be true...
The single most disgusting room I have ever been in. Check in is manned by teams of threes - they come prepared to fleece you and expect disgruntled customers, but as their terms and conditions mean you won’t get any refund, they have no reason to care.

4 receptionist at the front desk and 2 managers standing having a chat and a laugh in the back room, we was waiting for over 15 min !
I’ve asked the receptionist if possible to get a room with a nice view or balcny to enjoy the weather outside with a bottle of champagne and room service.
I’ve been told that balcony are only on the first floor and rooms are all booked ( I’ve mentioned that I don’t mind to pay more for what I’m asking ).
The receptionist called the manager and I’ve been told that it’s a room with a great view and no need to pay any extra.
Got in the room and it was a disaster.. no toilet paper, no view, no mini bar, toilet walls mouldy inside and fresh painted, could not open the window even if I asked to get a smokers room ( I’ve been asked if I’m a smoker or not )…
Went downstairs to collect some delivery as I was not convinced that its worth it to spend any more money at the hotel, I was about to make sure that the receptionist knows that he lied to me and that is not great but Ahmad came across asking if I would like any help and I had to explain to him the above, he did understand but however there was nothing he could do to fix the situation at the time apparently.
Next day in the morning I call the reception to extend my check-out to 1pm as my girlfriend she wasn’t feeling very well, the receptionist picked up the phone and answer with no manners and not even a good morning but she sounded not happy at all to pick up…”yes reception “ that is all she said..

And the view would have been nice if the windows had been cleaned.,"This hotel was a real disappointment. I thought I was booking a 4 stars Hotel with a grand interior. But this place must have had its prime 30 years ago. Already entering the lobby, you feel like you are in a mansion turned youth hostel. The vibe was very low class, very long queues by the reception at all times of day (check-in at 11pm took forever!), twin beds were uncomfortable (both too hard and way too narrow - not standard size), nice view over Canary Wharf but impossible to enjoy it because the windows were so dirty from the outside. No free WiFi, only an expensive option giving you 24 hours access on one device only, which in this day and age is ridiculous. Annoying details like soaps being changed every day, so you need to unpack a new hand soap, which is both impractical and a complete waste.
Crowd is more of a 2 stars hotel clientele, so you'll find empty glasses and old cigarettes and joints right outside the hotel, bar won't allow you to charge drinks on your room because ""if we give you free credit you might not be able to pay"". That says it all.
Lots of construction outside making it difficult to access from the tube. Dirty entrance (metal doors that are never polished so look filthy). 
Not coming back. Basically a 2 stars for the price of a 4 stars.",4.2

I arrived at just before mid-night and had I not been travelling for the entire day I would have gone downstairs and requested my money back. I am follicly challenged but there was enough hair in the bathroom to give me a multi-coloured wig. Hair everywhere of all colours and sizes. Make-up on the towels (which I don't wear) with a horrible shower. 
The furniture is clearly as old as the decor. Horribly uncomfortable bed and I couldn't bring myself to look at the mattress through fear of what I might find. 
I travel a lot in the UK and abroad and, quite simply, this is not a 4 Star hotel - no where near it. 
Next time I'll gladly pay the £100.00 more per night and stay in the Novotel across the road.

Only difference was size and it had controllable air conditioning, but it was still stuffy. Bed had a huge line down the middle and mattresses were different in how firm they were - so no snuggling or stretching out!

Checkout was at 11am with £10 for every hr extended.

The hotel had no mobile reception no signal on the tv so it was literally the worst stay I've had in any hotel in any part of the world and I am very well travelled.
It's unfortunate because the hotel could be a very nice place if they had some major major improvements.

My partner has a fear of dogs and to be locked in a lift 8 floors up with these two agressive hyperactive dogs was a total disgrace! My Fiancée was left shaken and scared for what was suppose to be a relaxing holiday!
Secondly, the heating was not working in our Room. We had to endure the 1st night in terrible conditions with 1 light blanket. Despite numerous switchboard/reception calls and finally a meeting with Hotel Manager the following morning and highlighting my Fiancée Health Issues as a (Cancer patient) and agreeing to install two portable heaters in our room as its was a 'Maintenance Issue' thats all they could do. My Fiancèe and I where dissapointed to return to our rooms for the second night to yet again no heating, nor any heaters.

Breakfast was ok.","It would be easy to miss the hotel from the side I came from (across the footbridge) - luckily it's opposite the Novotel (big glowing green sign!). Then it's difficult to work out how to get in.
The guy on the desk was really quite rude. His opening question was 'Can I see your photo ID' which I didn't have. He then went on to justify why he had every right to ask. He never smiled once. Never said enjoy your stay. Never provided any useful information.
He sold me dinner that turned out to be a very uninspiring buffet (veggie option pasta in tomato sauce, steamed mixed vegetables...) and took persuading to refund me when I wanted to eat elsewhere instead. I asked could I eat anywhere else (the desk is right next to an Indian restaurant called Spice) he said 'there's a pizzaria', no mention of the Indian restaurant at all.

1. No wifi in rooms - how does a 4 star hotel get away with charging £7 a day per device ? When I queried it the next day - they blamed their service provider !!
2. The antenna on the t.v. didn't work. So I couldn't watch t.v. I phoned down and they offered to send someone up but I said do it the next day - the next day it was marginally better but kept losing signal every few minutes for 10 seconds - making it pretty unwatchable.
so now - No WIFI and no TV.
Great.
3. Plug sockets near bed - I don't understand why hotels do this - it's the end of the day and you want to check your phone but have no power - so now have to stand up near the plug socket in order to do it.
Come on guys. You have to try much harder than this.
Check in took longer than expected too - when I got in the lift - the socket at the top where black glass goes was broken - it's just little things like that and having to pay for wifi and the tv not work.

The rooms are old and tatty, the sofas and stairs are all falling apart and pieced together with gaffa tape throughout the whole hotel. There was an extremely strong stench of cannabis everywhere you went even coming through the vents in the toilet in the rooms. We told staff about this stench but they were completely unphased and offered no solution whatsoever. We had to change rooms for the second of our two night stay as our first room was 30 degree heat with no way of opening a window or cooling it down. Staff promised they would get maintenance to have a look at this whilst we were out. When we got back to the room however the fan had been turned off and nothing had been done. The manager I spoke to was very polite and offered to either open our window with the special key or move us to balcony room. I opted to move as we were also on the 13th floor with the lift broken. The second room was much cooler however the heating in this room didn’t work at all! Luckily we like it cold!! The shower in our first room would only run on scalding hot. And in this second room we could only get ice cold water! I believe there may be some plumbing issues that need addressing!! We also saw a mouse (we hope not a rat!) running around in the bar one evening whilst we were enjoying our drinks. This was pointed out to staff by other guests who again did nothing. There was also only one competent bar man. The other was extremely slow and had no idea how to work the till. all in all I would not recommend this and I would never go back!",2.9

There is NO possible to open the window (the staff can do it for you (always?), but then you cannot close it yourself!) and there is an opening with grill on the ceiling where the hot air comes from -> but even thoug there is a display with buttons, it is NOT possible to regulate the temperature in the room. When the window was closed, the temperature was extremely hot (26.5°C). I arrrived at 2pm, changed the temperature on display to 22°C, went to the city and came back at 7pm - the temperature was again 26.5°C without the possibility to open the window ( I didn´t notice that if you change the temperature on the display, within 2-3 seconds it comes back to the original one = 26,5°C). So I had to ask the staff, they were very kind, came and opened my window. So I slept with the opened window and the hot air blowing out at the same time. And it was actually ok for me.

Meeting my colleagues in the Pizzeria, we were treated to some of the finest frozen pizza possibly sourced as a bankruptcy job lot from Kerry Katona's last engagement with Iceland...
Out to the lounge to get access to non-existent WiFi and we lounge in the luxurious ripped sofas surrounded by the views of Rat Poison bait and an aroma that drifted between feet and vomit...
Needless to say we passed on the promised eastern delights of Spice restaurant ... but we needn't have worried as when we returned to the hotel that evening it seems one of the guests/victims left what could only be described as a fine deposit in the Mens which filled the lobby and entrance to the usefully titled BAR with the full aroma of a medieval Nepali sewerage system... an olfactory delight you could literally taste in the air.
I say it was the Mens but somebody had helpfully used some of the letters in a Countdown frenzy to rename it the G_NTL_ME ...something the staff perhaps use to entertain themselves with during the days and night in what has the feel of a holding pen for the Jeremy Kyle show.
So in short its not somewhere i would ever recommend anybody to stay...the building however could be repurposed as a tourist exhibition in a Shining-esque horror show... complete with bloodstains on the walls, long never ending corridors and eerie moans from thr DLR in the middle of the night...

Since I booked this also for the fitness center facilities and this was not in any way advertised, I felt kind of robbed for my money and will actually seek a partial refund through Booking.com.
Getting there with public transport is pretty complex as you need to understand the ways through the Canary Wharf buildings, underground and overground passages, metro exit, etc. also the shortest way seems to be closed because of roadworks. There was no advice about that given by the hotel.
The general infrastructure looks in an urgent need of refurbishment; one elevator had the floors indicator broken exposing the electric cables; the room looked ancient, with the furniture beaten up, and even the Bible in the drawer (I thought this was really a relic of the past, I don't find that since ages!). There is a water boiler for coffee and tea available but no mini-fridge as they can't really fit it in that old furniture.
The large bed was actually two single beds on wheels put together and with the tendency to roll away quite easy so that it wasn't basically possible to use it as a single, large bed.
Air conditioning wasn't working, no matter what your set up, it kept staying at 28 degrees (!) and it wasn't possible to cool down the room no matter what you did.

Four trains before we could get on and the station entrance at at Bermondsey to Canary Wharf shut down because of overcrowding.

The transport connections to the city centre were good and there is a good mall next to the tube station.","The room was worn, dirty, run down, falling apart and depressive. The shower curtain had brown stains but apparently this wasn't considered a reason to change it because nothing happened after I mentioned it at reception. The front panel of the bath also came off. There was an unpleasant smell in the room - carpet cleaner or cockroach repellent? The Italian restaurant was uncomfortable, plain, canteen-like and not good food-wise either.",4.6

5684,Alfred,United Kingdom,Standard Double Room,1 night ·  October 2018,Couple,"Reviewed: October 9, 2018",Don't do it.,Checking out!,"I think the main importance of staying in an hotel is the ability to have a good night sleep. This did not happen because of the state and condition of the mattress (spring's gone) and the size of the single blanket provided coupled with uncomfortable pillows. My wife is considerable shorter than me and managed to only just fit in the bed while i struggled not to kick her out as I lay next to her. Being not very big myself only just under 6 foot and my wife over 5 foot found this strange to start with and would recommend strongly to have two single beds requested, not the midget bed we got and also request additional blankets.
Also the calming part of a bedroom is the relaxing colours chosen, however this has not been been passed onto the owners as the dated decor, an old warn bathroom that need plumbing issues rectified, (took nearly five minutes for the sink to drain) helped give an almost Basle Faulty appearance (hotel lift screen broken, glass and Champagne bottles left on our floor near lifts for nearly 15 hours). The breakfast served was poor, as I do not like the fact that when the bacon is selected and lifted up, it stuck to about nine other pieces along with a sausage that tasted strange at best.
I know that we did not pay a premium for the hotel and ordered one with a view which we received. But for value for money you can do a lot better as London is not short of accommodation which I believe will offer a good nights sleep. I have never normally complained but feel, in my opinion this hotel needs major work carried out to offer the guest an experience they should expect, with me for one never going back.

She throughly inspected my ID as if I were a criminal, she then asked for my partners ID and did the same thing. When we arrived in our room we were bursting to for the toilet. When I entered the bathroom there were feaces marks in the toilet bowl, there was also dirt marks on the toilet seat where someone had been sitting. 
After a long day at work this was last thing we wanted to see. The hand towel also had yellow stains on it and that was the last straw so I called concierge. They asked me if I had used the facilities to which I replied I have just arrived in my room (we checked in late after work around 5pm), the person on the phone repeated the question another two times to which I replied with the same answer. I feel like he was doubting me. I was then informed that house keeping had already gone home and I would need to change rooms. 
We came down to reception and waited in a queue for 15mins just to get a room change, the man who served me seemed very unimpressed of why I wanted to change my room, service with no smile. 
After we got to the new room, I finally used the bathroom and took a shower. As I opened the bath towel there were black marks on the towel, unfortunately I forgot to take pictures of it as I was just so annoyed by that point. I used a hand towel to dry my body as there were no spare towels in the cupboard. 
In the morning I asked house keeping for a new towel and the lady seemed very reluctant to give me a clean towel, I explained to her the towels I had were never clean and she looked on her list and checked my room was ‘late checkout’ (even though it was not) she then happily handed over two towels.

Waited for ten minutes to get a drink at the bar as three staff were trying to sort some problem out so gave up and found a nice Turkish restaurant around the corner instead.
Had to pay £21 to park overnight, no safety deposit boxes in the rooms, they also had to be paid for in reception,which I thought was a bit strong.
The only positive where the staff at the reception.
Overall I would strongly recommend you look at the other hotels next door and nearby.",5.0

Met manager and she said she didn’t have time to talk (great customer service). Also that they have many rooms and are unable to monitor all rooms. I told her to adopt a simple cleaning rota system or close some of the rooms. Lastly when the manager went into her office I heard the word “arshole” and two colleagues looked over and laughed. We asked for the glass in the upgraded room to be cleaned whilst we were at dinner. We returned at midnight to find it was still in the room. Another manager was called up and the room was hoovered at 1pm. I request a free drink which we were given and the room service would have be £5. I think the small claims court would have been more for the glass on my bleeding foot!!! Having worked as an investement banker for 20 years in Canary Wharf the standards have clearly dropped.

Canary Wharf in itself is business-focused, with good options to mingle with the locals along the river Thames where several nice restaurants and bars are situated.","Hotel looks sparkly upmarket from the outside but is quite run down on the inside. Carpet that comes lose at the edges and in the corners, elevators that were missing buttons and were alarmingly rattling, upside down bent soap dishes in the bath - minor details maybe, but a sign that maintenance is under-prioritised and repairs are not promptly taken up (one of the elevators was out of service during our entire stay). Staff was not very friendly nor welcoming - they did just the bare minimum of checking in, and shared not even the slightest bit of standard information (such as where to find the elevators to get to our room). Housekeeping could definitely be improved - dustbin was not emptied, towels were taken away but not replaced, general cleanliness of the room was not very impressive.

The layout and design were dated. Whilst the locker rooms / changing area appeared to be modern the swimming pool area left a lot to be desired. The wood work was rotten in many places particularly around the door frames and the spiral staircase down to the swimming pool was rusted and mouldy. I have never stayed in a hotel where you had to pay extra to use the pool once you are a guest. The jacuzzi was boiling and the pool was freezing despite a notice that the temperature was 29 degrees. It wasn’t. Needless to say, we stayed 20 minutes and left as the experience was not pleasurable. 
The shower over the bath was very temperamental and it took ages to find a temperature where one didn’t scald or freeze under the water. One of the fittings was broken and instead of attempting to fix it or take it away, it was just left there!! We didn’t eat on the premises so I can’t comment on the food or beverages. 
The front area was well kept and I noticed the carpet being hoovered on a number of occasions. It certainly appeared to be a busy hotel but it lacked an atmosphere. I don’t know that area of London and I booked only one week beforehand so it served its purpose but I wouldn’t return.",4.6

In a word, I was really disappointed, and I will never stay here again. 
The staff was unhelpful, unprofessional and unavailable. 
1: I provided my credit card information when I booked. One day before the check-in day, I received an email ask me update my credit card information, as the provided one was 'invalid' and cannot be processed. But after I checked the bank statement, it did be charged already. When I was checking in, I asked the staff. But the staff didn't check it or even answer me. 
2: When I stored my luggage after I checked out, the staff was not in the counter. When he came, I said ‘can I store my luggage here’. He didn’t hear it at first time, then just stared at me. I asked again. Then, he started to censure me ‘Ok, I’m waiting for you say something, if you don’t say something, how can I know what you want………..’ 
3: When I came back to collect the luggage in the afternoon, there was no staff at the concierge. Then I talked to the staff at the reception. The lady just said ‘Please wait for a moment, my colleague will be there soon’, and didn’t do anything, didn’t ask any colleague to help. I was waiting for about 10min until someone knocked the office (beside the reception) and a staff came out to help me. Then I realized there is someone in the office and I should knock the door to get him, rather than ask the staff at reception for help. 
THE LAST, for the WIFI, I cannot believe that I need to pay for it to use it in the room, in a 4 star hotel. Cannot you just increase the rent and provide the free WIFI?

This wasted 20 mins after a long journey & the hotel's attitude just irritated me more. The replacement room was also in a very poor condition. I was made to feel that I was just being a nuisance & I felt too intimidated to complain further. To have lost another half hour and wait for the unsmiling, unsympathetic duty manager again was, for me, an option I didn't wish to repeat.
The carpet stank & was badly stained & dirty - and I mean Seriously Stained. The only place it was fit for was a skip...its so bad that I wouldn't have it outside my garage let alone inside. I never went barefoot in the room at all.
The room had old & broken furniture; filthy, damaged walls with, not just marks, but chunks taken out of them; the control for the AC/heating didn't do the job although it sounded as if it worked; the large window was damaged which meant that it could not be altered from its wide open position & the constant traffic noise volume kept me awake.
The 2 lifts at the the far end took forever & when I nipped up the stairs exit, I was really shocked to see 2' strips of black gaffer tape across MOST of the treads' edges - which were keeping the thread bare carpet together (& presumably acting as a makeshift tripping hazard avoidance measure!)
I began to wonder if the 2nd floor is used as accommodation for Social Housing.
I'm positive that if I'd have had a 6' guy with me who would have said something like 'No mate, are you having a laf?",3.8

We were woken up in the early hours thanks to doors being slammed, people shouting, all because the walls seemed paper thin.There was no WiFi in the rooms, only available in public areas !!, no bottled water supplied no the rooms, the hotel’s lifts were abysmal, very poorly maintained and had broken displays, only one of three worked. The breakfast was terrible, some of the items had passed their best for sure and it was obvious that the cheapest quality produce had been used.

During our stay, all lifts were broken except for one so we had to wait at least 15-20 minutes each time. Worst of all, someone punched the board inside the only lift left so we had no idea to which floor the lift had arrived. They couldn’t be bothered to fix it. The staff didn’t care and one of them actually told my mother so. The rooms were small and smelled very old. The sink in my parents’ room were broken and blocked. We called reception four times but no one showed up until the next day. There is no free WiFi in the room and it is extremely expensive to buy. We ended buying a SIM card from EE and hotspot the whole family for 5 days. No idea how this hotel gets its 4 star status. Hope it gets closed down soon. Never ever again!",2.5

For me there are only three things that matter in a hotel room: the bed, the shower, and that it is all clean and fresh -- the basic needs of a traveller. The rooms had been cleaned, but were not clean, the bed was dreadful, the shower was fine, and staff, facilities, location too.
Conclusion: deep clean the rooms and the air conditioning ducts, and replace the mattresses. Simple, right?",Not Available,6.7

But some others are lack of responsibility, empathy. I arrived on 20th April afternoon. When I enter my room, room temperature is 32 C and in room air condition was not working. I tried to lowerdown the temperature but it automatically went up 32 C. 
BWhen I told one lady who is doing housekeeping. She informed another lady who came into the room and tried to open window but failed and went back. Then 30 minutes later I rang to housekeeping and some one said that one person will be coming. I waited there but up to 55 minutes no one come and I can’t stayed in room of 32-33 C anymore. 
And then I want down the reception and told receptionist that I want to change my room. She asked me “ did you use toilet ? and inform to her senior. After that she told me no room left and she would inform engineer who would try to fix before midnight but it is not sure he can fix it or not. I told her what should I do? I booked very early, paid for two days, can’t stay anymore in room of 32-34C.( at that time more than 1 hr and may be up midnight)
She said that she arrange to open my window and then I went back to my hot room to wait someone. 10 minutes later one guy come in and remove screw by machine and then the window opened. 
He said “”this is not our fault because system failure”
So I want to ask
Is this my fault to get this room?

My booking was for room without window, but I was checked into a room with window, so that was nice! 
The room was larger than expected, had ample floor space, lots of storage etc.
 Lots of tv channels. 
Coffee/tea in room. 
Helpful friendly staff. 
Location is ok- minutes walk from Canary Wharf, easy to access.","Discoloured shower curtains, cheap thin toilet paper, really uncomfortable bed (can feel all the springs, I actually got bruises from laying down!), I don’t think the duvet cover has been changed since the last guests stayed - it looked and felt dirty, not crisp as the pillows and sheet felt like. You can tell when something isn’t clean/has been slept in already. 
No proper internet in the room, you get 2 x 20 minutes for free, then you need to buy voucher for any extra minutes. A day pass is £7. Apparently WiFi is free in lobby though. 
 The rooms looks run down, and could do with some serious upgrades, but was expecting this from other reviews. 
The shower head could not be moved up and down, which is quite annoying for someone as tall as me wanting to wash their hair. 
The tap in bathroom splashed water everywhere - it just needs a filter/mesh fitted to stop this! (Very easy to fix). 
No sockets by the bed to charge phone etc, the lamp plugs are not normal UK plugs and as such could not keep phone on bedside overnight. 
Noisy from construction and dlr, but that needs to be expected. 
No fridge/mini bar. 
Old thin towels that are due an upgrade as the rest of the hotel. Towels should be nice and fluffy in hotels, not scratch your skin.

-The shower went from hot to cold water
-I paid for a double room and received 2 single mattresses together. I explained to reception and was told this is what a double bed is, I argued back saying it's not a double bed, it's two single beds. 
-The furniture looks like it's been pulled out of a tip, scratched and damaged.
-The carpets and wallpaper are disgusting.
-The breakfast had so much oil on it I was on the lookout for the US army.
-The view from the window was obscured by the amount of grime stuck to it. They haven't seen a good scrub since the 1990's.
-2x 9 inch cheese pizzas arrive 90 minutes later, cold, undercooked and looked like a pre school student made it in their first week of cooking class.
-Overall this hotel has a lot of potential, especially the old fashioned decor if it was taken care of by a team of carpenters and the carpets/wallpaper were replaced but whoever's is leading the upper management of this company is either deliberity running it into the ground or is severely incompetent.

This meant that we requested early check-in between 8-9am (check in was requested a week prior to visit) from the hotel, which was confirmed by the hotel. It was also stated in the email that it would be FREE OF CHARGE. We arrived at the hotel between 9-9:30am to be told there were no rooms and were asked to wait for half an hour for a room to possibly be free. We then asked again about a room after half an hour and was told by a different member of staff there were no rooms. We explained our situation again and nothing was done to accommodate or help us in any way, we were just told that there were no rooms at that time and that we could wait until 11/12pm if we wanted to. By this point we were already an hour late to the start of the conference so we weren’t very happy, especially considering I tried to show both members of staff the early check in confirmation and neither of them seemed interested. After another 15 minutes of frustrated waiting I went back to the front desk to speak to the first member of staff. I was polite, calm and apologetic about being so pushy but again explained that we really needed a room as we had somewhere to be, and that it wasn’t fair for them to confirm early check in if it was not going to be provided for us. She then went to speak to her manager and we were finally given a room, but not before she asked that I pay a £10 extra early check-in fee for a request that I was told would be free of charge.

Im Jubelee Park, einem Einkaufszentrum, das unmittelbar an der Tubestation liegt, kann man prima und in Ruhe shoppen, nahezu rund um die Uhr etwas essen (Nandoos, Asiate, Sushi...) und Geld aus dem Automaten ziehen. Das Hotel selbst hat mich positiv überrascht - der morbide Charme wurde ja schon von anderen erwähnt. Wenn man keinen Luxus erwartet und einen die eine oder andere zerbrochen Fliese im Bad oder ein wackeliges Bett nicht stören, für den ist das Hotel eine wirklich gute Wahl. Einchecken, auschecken, Koffer bei Ankunft morgens ins Deposit geben – das alles hat gut und rasch funktioniert. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Gefrühstückt haben wir nicht im Hotel, in London kann man das prima unterwegs tun. Auch gibt es in der Shopping Mall nette Cafés, u.a. ein Starbucks Café, wer mag. Etwa 100 Meter entfernt ist ein passabler Inder, gegenüber ein kleiner Supermarkt mit guten/normalen Preisen, wenn man etwa Wasser kaufen will. Das Leitungswasser schmeckt nicht.",,7.5

In der heutigen Zeit etwas schwach für ein Londoner Hotel. Manchmal funktionierte das Wlan nicht, da ich scheinbar mein Wlan für diesen Tag „aufgebraucht“ habe, obwohl ich den ganzen Tag nicht im Hotel war. Das Personal blieb sehr hartnäckig und wollte mir nicht entgegenkommen. Sie beschuldigten mich nur und sagten sie können mir nicht helfen. Wenn man mehr als 40 Min Wlan braucht, muss man 7 GBP für 24h wlan zahlen. 
- Bett war ziemlich unbequem, Kissen sehr flach. Habe an der Reception nach einem anderen Kissen gefragt. Sie hatten kein anderes und gaben mir dasselbe (nach 40 Minuten).
- Keine Klimaanlage, nur ein Kleiner Ventilator. Für den Sommer ist dieses Hotel nicht geeignet. Im Winter hat man eine Heizung. Doch durch den grossen Spalt unter der Türe kam die Kälte rein. Habe jede Nacht den Spalt mit einem Handtuch gestopft, da es sonst zu kalt wurde.
- Wir hatten ein sehr einfaches Zimmer ohne Fenster (wie gebucht). Doch das Zimmer war nicht sauber und es roch immer komisch, da der Teppich nicht sauber war. Wir hatten ein Badezimmer für Behinderte, obwohl wir kein solches benötigten. Das Waschbecken war sehr klein und sehr tief unten. Man konnte sich selbst die Hände nicht richtig waschen.
