All ok except the cost of parking,We had a budget 2 night stay and its a well set hotel a short walk from the shopping malls in Canary Wharf and 2 minutes from the tube into London. So location is top marks. Service was ok and the room good if a little hot and slightly dated. We had value for  money in the cost. The breakfast was buffet style and eat your heart out. They should serve the coffee though - its help yourself. The parking though is 21 pounds a day so get your card out !!!!!!. So worth a go in location if you have the right deal .We had a great view of the water too- 3rd floor/!!!!!!!!!,Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Bad experience overall,"I had the worse experience ever. The furniture is old, the room stinks, the beds are small, other than the reception desk who are trained and nice .... the service is bad. I was kicked out from the breakfast room because my name is not in the list! although I told the waiter upfront that I will pay for the breakfast!",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Better than expected,"stayed as part of a national coach trip ,pleasantly impressed much better than we expected after staying at other Britannia Hotels. We had a nice room very roomy ,clean and modern bed fine nice bedding . Food carvery style but for what you pay good value for money couldn't complain . Drinks a little pricey but i suppose hotel prices ,staff all very pleasant",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Dismal,"I booked a double room six months in advance of staying here before the London Marathon. Turned up to be told there weren't any double rooms left, with no apology or sense of remorse. The twin room I was given was very tired-looking and noisy - you could hear the light railway outside and a lot of noise from rooms either side. Some room service plates in the corridor outside my room (not mine) were not moved throughout my stay. Thoroughly unimpressed.",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Good value for weekend break,"Service was very good, room was large and comfortable, hotel could do with a bit of TLC however it was good value and in excellent  location.

Location is the best thing,"Stayed here for 1 night before the London Marathon so it was close to accessing the starting line at Greenwich Park (tube very close to here and plenty of restaurants around to walk to). Big old hotel, room ok but needed renovating. Narrow single beds although a double was requested. Basic and ok for the price, and convenient.",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Nice Reasonable hotel,I booked this last minute and luckily got the reservation. Staff is kind. It was a good stay.

ok for london,"this hotel is not the savoy but neither is the price, for london it is not bad the food is not great but breakfast is ok with no limits and good choice , there are plenty of good food pubs and restaurants within walking distance on the wharf and it is an interesting place to take a walk on a nice night. The bar is ok but the seats are an art to get in and out of . Overall for the price a good mid range hotel that is a bit overdue a refurb but you only sleep there and the rooms aren't to bad",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
One of Britannia's Best Hotels,"Arrived on a National Holidays 3 day coach trip.  Was upgraded to a twin room which was quite large and well equipped including an iron & ironing board & a flat screen TV with Freeview channels.  As with all Britannia Hotels the room would benefit greatly from a major refurbishment as the decor is very tired. The major let down in the room (409) was the shower which you could only stand underneath if you are under 5ft tall.  It was also very difficult to get the temperature right.  The food in Jenny's Restaurant was OK, but especially at dinner, it was obvious it was low quality.  The public areas of the hotel are well decorated and furnished to a high standard.  The bar is reasonably priced for London, and all the staff in the hotel were polite and very helpful.  The hotel is",Date of stay: April 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Vile out of date hotel, riddled with moths and carpets eaten by bugs!!! Do not stay here it is more like 1 star!!","This hotel is vile, we had three different rooms which varied in horrible experiences! First room was like a box, with no windows, 2nd room infested with moths, 3rd room slightly better but back to no windows.  I have attached some pictures of the eaten carpet to give you an idea of how vile it is. This hotel is more like a 1/2 star, disappointing as Canary Wharf is such a modern area!

Affordable Quality,"We arrived near to the hotel whilst the London Marathon was on. A great bonus. The hotel staff were all friendly,extremely polite and very helpful. Our room was beautiful.Clean, tidy fresh and inexpensive for London. We saw at the O2 that night Neil Sedaka. The underground train from the O2 took 5 minutes to bring us to thecanary wharf stop. The walk back to the hotel was through buildings that had security guards on 24 hour watch. very very safe. lovely trip lovely hotel lovely people go for it",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Angela,National holidays booked in a three bedded room with my husband and 15 year old daughter. On booking the girl rang the hotel too. To find the room with a put-up bed. Totally unsuitable. Paperwork states 3 bedded room. No compensation no apology and paid full price for 3 adults. Disgusted with the lack of empathy or resolution to the problem. No manager to speak to. Just concierge.  Spoilt our holiday,Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Avoid,"You will see from my profile that I don't do hatchet jobs but this deserves one. From the hopeless check in, to the noisy rooms next to the Railway, to the aircon that doesn't work, to the complimentary drink of apology that I later found had been charged to my room, and on checkout mo one asked how the stay had been......

Box room,"Visited London, with my daughter age 8, to watch the Army Navy rugby game. Arrived on the Friday morning, and we're allowed to go to the room early, 1130 am. Had booked through booking.com. I had booked breakfast.  On arrival , was told that the booking didn't include breakfast, and it was going to be £10 extra per person per day. The price was for a double room, with no windows. Once in the room, through the maze of corridors never walked the same route twice,found it to be a box room with a double bed.The bathroom was smaller than my flats. The hotel was near the river bus, and the tube which is handy. There is WiFi, and it's free for ,20 minutes. I've stayed in better Britannia hotels before and cheaper ones too. Totally disappointed in the hotel, and wouldn't recommend.",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
cheap/ good location for visiting London,ok. so the international isn't going to get an award for best breakfast or swanky rooms but it's adequate and in the brittania style. Ask for a room upgrade and make sure you book on groupon. Don't pay full price.  The hotel is in a great location and we had a nice and quiet weekend. 5 min walk and it was Very easy to jump on London transport and get anywhere pretty quick.  breakfast was cooked well and plentiful but its all cheaper end products.  Staff are helpful but typically a mix of foreign workers. Some staff are better english speakers than others. The room was cleaned but carpets stained. The hotel needs a refurb pretty desperately. All pretty basic and bed a little uncomfortable but it's ok. Its cheap and well located.

Comfortable 1 night stay close to O2 arena,"We wanted a hotel in a good location for O2 arena at a sensible price. We paid £139 for a double room, no window and no breakfast and I'd say it was a fair price for the location. We were offered a complimentary upgrade to room with window but were told it would be two single mattresses zipped together - they were in fact just twin beds. We didn't really mind as it was a functional stay without much time in the room. It is 10mins walk from Canary Wharf tube and that is one stop away from the O2 - we were there within 25 mins so that was great. The hotel staff were really helpful and check in was fast. They were only too willing to provide extra toiletries for the room when I asked. Generally attentive with plenty of smiles all round!

Comfortable cheap Hotel,"Just had a long weekend stay over Easter and found the Hotel just about acceptable. Comfortable if tired rooms and furnishings throughout the Hotel.  Take no notice of anything that says free WiFi because its not. You get a token free 20 minutes. Breakfast Ok if you don't mind queuing, Evening Carvery which we experienced was not particularly good.  Location is pretty good, handy for Tube DLR and River taxi. 02 not far. Second time staying here and will probably not stay again as I believe it is well overdue a good refurbishment. Lots of building work going on around the Hotel which makes the roads locally somewhat dangerous. Nearer a 2 star rather than a 4 star.",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Could be better,"Our room initially seemed lovely - very spacious and light with the full length windows. A very reasonable price also at £55 for one night (although we had received a complimentary upgrade to a room with a window). However there are a number of things which hindered the room preventing it from a 4* or 5* rating. Firstly our double bed consisted of two single mattresses bolted together. The room was very very warm, and the air conditioning was poor not making the entire room cool and taking an age to do any sort of temperature change. It was also rather noisy. Wifi in rooms also costs £7 per day (!!!!) apart from a free 20 minute session - when every single tube station now has free wifi, how can't a hotel situated right by Canary Wharf not? The hotel does have a pool, gym, bar",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Good location,"We stayed for 1 night in April to visit London and we went to Lindsey Stirling concert. When we went in I was disappointed. I expected a stunning hotel as on the photos and I saw old and dated hallway and room.  However, really good location, I never been on this site of the London. Easy acces to all comunication. Room - old-fashioned and desperately needs refurbishment. There's an old musk smell and a lot of things feel grubby. Although the bed was really comfortable! I woke up happy and rested.  Breakfast was good - buffet - variety of food, different kind of bread, ham, cereals etc. Tastsy. Nice drinks over bar, but old, dirty and smelly sofas to sit on. Not nice.

Grand but a bit run down now,"I remember when I first moved to London and stayed in this place and it was so grand.  Now, it still has that same grand feel and the bar by the water is always nice but I can't deny that it all felt a little drab.  The room was functional and I have to say not having a plug socket near the bed is completely unacceptable nowadays.  Charging my phone across the room simply isn't on.  Ended up having to move my bed.  Other than that... I'm giving it four stars for nostalgia but really it's a 3 star hotel nowadays.  The pizza restaurant isn't too bad either.",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Grotty, run down and nothing like the photos.","We recently stayed here for three nights after booking what was billed as a four star hotel. The hotel is seriously shabby and dirty. The room we were initially given was dirty, mouldy and cold. The beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. The heated swimming pool that looked so lovely in the photos was also dirty and cold. To add insult to injury, there was an additional cost. On request we were moved to a better room but it still didn't feel very four star. The lifts were smelly with the odour of urine and marijuana. The hotel was surrounded by building work (not the hotel's fault but guests should be warned) which impeded access to the hotel. The advertised spa facilities were out of action.

Horrible,I chose this hotel as had to go to hotel near Canary Wharf. Did not expect much as I got a good rate for London. When I checked in I asked for Internet and the receptionist said that she asked about that by a lot of clients today. How strange nowadays. Then you can only have it free for 20 Minutes in your room. I forgot my charging cable. The hotel did not have one to borrow and was not able to tell me how long shops are open at Canary Wharf.  Very strange for a concierge not to know that and I was under the impression he did not care at all. Coming up to the lifts it smelled of a mixture of Indian cuisine from the restaurant and pool. The furniture and specially the carpets are pretty run down which ok happens after a while.

Hotel by the Waterfront,Good Location for all Canary Wharf offices and attractions.  Rates are very economical for its area.  Good restaurant options inside and outside the hotel.

I had so much hope and I still do but...,"I love the layout of this hotel, it’s so grand or maybe I should of said, it could be. We was given a beautiful upgrade and I loved the spa bath! what this place is lacking is TLC.  The Staff on the welcome desk were very nice and smiled and were pleasant as one would expect, however the staff in the restaurant in the morning during Breakfast, were far from this: None appeared to smile or speak English, none asked if we needed anything when they came and took the plates off the table, while I was still eating. (they removed Items without asking if you were done).  oh and please learn how to cook. A boiled egg is not Grey! its been sitting in warm water for far too long for it to have come out like that.

If there was something lower than 1 they have it,"I don't even need to finish the stay to give my feedback. For some reason this time I didn't check trip advisor.   Right from the start a problem with the booking and while trying to sort it out asked/told to move out of the way. Desperate upselling at the desk for dinners and breakfast. As others have said very  dated decor. Bed was hard with very thin mattress that you could feel the springs   The room was 26.5 degrees. Supposedly maintenance would be sent finally someone arrived who obviously was not that but a  staff member. His amazing solution open the window and said the air conditioning is not fast cool.

Just terrible,"Good location and cheaper that other hotels in the area but really one of the worst hotels I have ever visited.  Putting the aesthetics of the dated and shabby rooms to one side, it is physically unpleasant to be in this hotel. Rooms are  too hot, windows don't open, AC doesn't work and there is no bottled water in the rooms.  You have to pay extra for everything e.g. WiFi, adaptors, gym etc and the staff don't seem to care or do not have the power to put things right. Each time  I went to the foyer it was echoing to the sounds of guests complaining and not getting satisfactory answers. At breakfast we bonded with strangers about just how grim it all was.

"No window, no temp control, expensive","We paid £139 for a very basic room with no window and no temp control. Felt like we were underground. There was a 1970's wardrobe in the corner of the room with a well used ironing board leaning against it. The room was very warm.  We asked if we could control the room temp or have a different room with a window and were offered a desk fan or a room with a window for £159 for one night. We already felt we had paid well over the odds for a basic room with no breakfast so took the fan.  The ventilation was extremely loud and neither of us slept much because of it.

Overpriced for what i experienced.,Firstly let me say that there are a few pros - The staff. FANTASTIC. I could not praise them enough. The entrance is grand and you feel welcomed from that point on. What i feel let down by are a few things. Firstly i booked a twin room for me and my running mate through hotels.com not a crime i thought. When my mate dropped out through injury i thought i would upgrade to a family room. I couldn't change my booking apparently. So i booked another twin room. So that's £199 for the first room and £145 for the 2nd. For that money i could of stayed at The Dorchester. The two rooms were lifeless and tired. I must add they were clean though.

We had a very large balacony that run along the lengh of about 5 to 6 rooms so we could sit and take in the lovely view.

At check-in I was given an opportunity to upgrade to a higher level room with a window for £20 extra - I declined. Other people checking in were also being offered the same 'great deal' to upgrade to a room with a window.  When I got to my room I was surprised to see curtains. When I opened the curtains I was even more surprised to see a window, and a view. I wonder if this is just a tactic to get people who book the cheap rooms to part with more money.

First impressions is that it is dated - it states it is the first hotel to be built on Canary Wharf, which really means it is the oldest hotel on Canary Wharf and you can tell as I don't think it has been renovated since then!  Very dated décor, wripped wall paper, worn carpets and quite dark throughout.    However our room was very spacious, clean - it had windows!  We had a nice view of the City and the River.  The DLR runs through Canary Wharf but it wasn't too noisy.

Room very tired, aircon not working first night so they unscrewed the window to let some air in, which made the sound of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) going past every 5 minutes truly memorable. The next day they forgot to fix the aircon and not until the 3rd night did I have a chance of sleep.

Upon leaving our room at 6pm to go for dinner, my niece spotted a rat run across the corridor and into the utility room opposite our room ( number 172 on the first floor). We went into the utility room so she could take a photo. She spotted the rat again but it was too quick.

Very tasty food.,"I have just returned from staying at this hotel whilst on a National Holidays 3 day getaway. Firstly the hotel has no information for visitors to London, so you get no maps, no tube, bus or train information. Canary Wharf is a building site and what that means is certain paths are blocked off so using mobile maps leads you up dead ends. The staff keep London maps under the reception desk...out of sight, so please ask for one if you need it. The staff we asked seemed vague of the area. However once we spoke to a very kind Scottish workman, he told us everything we needed to know and really cant thank him enough and in turn we were able to help two further families also stuck as to how to get around.

The room....a complete mismatch of everything and it desperate need of a complete overhaul and had the most audible air conditioning unit i have ever come across. it made noise even when it wasn't on??

Worst four star hotel I've even been in,"Really needs an upgrade or to be closed. There is no way this hotel should be allowed to say it's 4 star. It's shabby, not particularly clean and very uncomfortable. The decor is incredibly dated with threadbare patches in the carpets and pealing wall paper.  I'm not sure the mattresses have ever been changed since the hotel opened. My bedroom window didn't open meaning I had to rely on very noisy air conditioning just to keep the temperature down to anything close to acceptable and even then it was still too hot.  It's not even particularly cheap. Do not stay here.",Date of stay: April 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Would not stay here again,"I would definitely not stay at this hotel again. My work booked a standard double room for me. When I arrived the lady at the reception offered me a ""free upgrade to a much bigger executive room with an amazing view"". That executive room is a standard size room with twin beds rather than a double and the window overlooks a massive construction site and there is a train line right outside too with trains going by every 3 minutes. It's so loud I can hardly hear the TV.  At the reception they offered me a 3 course meal at their restaurant for £12,50 which I bought. That was a buffet in their restaurant called Jenny or Jennifer.

Good value for a deal,"Got this hotel on a deal website - just stayed for the one night. Main attraction is the location - in Canary Wharf and easy access to a lot of London. There are lots of facilities in the hotel, however I don’t feel the most is made of them - they’re all just okay. The pool and spa could be fantastic but seems old and not well kept. The same for the breakfast - could be great but just average.  Little things like rust and broken buttons in the lift or crap showers take away from the overall charm. The rooms are old fashioned in design but this adds to the quirks of the hotel. Overall if they improved things like the facilities and kept it traditional yet clean and polished they could charge more and this would be a top hotel.

Really nice stay,"After reading previous reviews before arrival I was a little worried what we might be walking into. I could not be more wrong! The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was clean and did the job (you don’t go away to sit in the room the whole time!) only slight issue being the air con problem, which can’t be helped, wouldn’t knock them down for that. They gave us a free fan and opened our window so made it bearable. Ate in the Pizzeria on our first night which was a good choice, pizza was fab- not too greasy, husband had homemade beef burgers and said they were lovely too! Bar staff chatty and made good cocktails. Overall, I think this was a good choice and we would return if we are in the area again :)",Date of stay: April 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
This Britannia does not rule the waves,Where do I begin.... THink Crossroads and Fawlty Towers and a bad edition of The Hotel Inspector.....  Utterly dreadful I know some will say you pay for what you get but there comes a point....  Our first room offered...Chipped paint false ceiling complete with strip lighting and no window.... It had a real 1974's feel mixed with crime scene on a future CSI  So we asked to be moved NOWHERE on booking form did it say it was a economical room (Hotel's wording ) it is listed as a city view room.........Oh also no Air Con the room was hotter than the earths core.........

After a mix up with booking.com I was given on arrival at smoking room that smelt disgusting...even though I had two children with me.  While issuing my complaint I was told by the sed DM no apology was needed as it was as simple as ""just moving room""  I was disgusted by this lack of consideration having travelled for 8 hours with two kids.  The receptionist issued us with a new key for a different room.  The DM was furious to say the least.  He looked at my booking and said this states only 1 adult.  He ordered me to call booking.com.

4* entrance 3*rooms,"Stayed early August as a 1 night stop over. The hotel is about 10 mins from jubilee line *it's quicker to head towards the dock water and around than over the bridge. The entrance is about as grand as you can get. Gold guilt, oak panelled walls, marble statues. The reception desk were quick and efficient. I'm guessing the earlier reviews about waiting ages at check - in must have been between 10am-1pm when most people check in/out like every hotel in the world!!! The room was presented as a high class. Glass chandelier, awful paintings of victorian women. Bevelled mirrors. However on closer look it's a standard 3 star room.

Disappointing,"Just returned from a National Holiday Break,we were very diappointed with having to queue for our evening meal and then to find a lack of choice for vegeterians. The following morning was even worse we queued for 45mins to get breakfast and struggled to carry everything at once because we didn't want to rejoin the queue again, there were no clean tables for us to sit at and we were then moved to another ajoining resturant. This delay made us late for our coach.The leisure facilities were also a disappointment, pool and jacuzzi  closed.

Everything is an extra charge!,"Whilst on a business trip to Canary Wharf, myself and some colleagues stayed in this hotel for 2 nights.  I will not be going back.  The price for the room is OK, and I guess that is how they sell the rooms, however bear in mind that NOTHING comes as standard with that price. THe below is a list of items that you will have to pay extra for: - WIFI (In your room GBP7 / night - this is free in the lobby) - Gym (GBP4) - Gym Towel (cant remember how much)  Now you may think I'm being unreasonable, but in my opinion these things should be included on your room.

First Visit to London,"This hotel is excellently placed away from the hustle & bustle of the centre of London but near to an excellent tube station. The hotel décor is very dated, stuck in the 90's.

The staff also never seemed to smile.",Date of stay: August 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Good for the price, but loud at night and some poor service.","For the price we paid (approx £180 for 3 nights in a double room), this was a great location. The room was clean and well kept. However, it's certainly not a 4* hotel - it's very much a 3* hotel, so selling themselves as a 4* is definitely pushing it. In our room, there was a huge amount of noise coming from our ceiling, like a grinding fan or something, that made it very hard to sleep. Furthermore, the room service was rude and poor. I called up with no response, so thought I may have entered the wrong number. When I called again, I had an angry lady on the end of the phone who told me that ""We're busy so maybe you should have thought that's why we didn't pick up your call"".

Misleading,"As a family we booked 2 nights through national holidays.. We didn't know what hotel we was staying in... At first glance the hotel looks lovely, nice hall way and lounge. Got checked in fast... We had 2 twin rooms booked. The rooms where in need of a refurbishment. The single beds are prob about the same size as the ones you get in a caravan. Very small and not comfortable at all. The food.. Well Jenny's restaurant is what you get with the package. The food wasn't very good, especially the evening meal, only one choice for a veggie, and not very kid friendly with the food. No taste at all. The breakfast was much better tho.

There seemed to be no contingency plan, and we left waiting for 30 minutes before we’d even checked in. Once checked in the situation became increasingly worse, the interior of your building is outdated and in need of refurbishment. Frayed carpets in the hallway, 60’s wallpaper, a Grants whiskey bottle left in the corridor, chipped tables in the room with missing handles, temperature advisories on the taps missing, the shower holster falling off the wall, a double bed in what was told to be a twin room, a window we couldn’t close considering there was an air vent outlet directly outside our window and air conditioning unit that did not work",Date of stay: August 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

The hotel is dirty, the gym/spa are dirty, old and the equipment is, in the main, unusable! We tried to use the gym, were charged extra to do so and it is filthy and the equipment was old and mainly not fit for purpose.

Windows were dirty. Breakfast was bad. Watered down coffee, watered down orange juice, massproduction, canned fruit, no fresh vegetables at all, very smelly place, greasy everywhere. I felt sorry for the staff who has to work in such a ""pig stable"". Restaurant greasy and unfresh. We ordered a club sandwich for 10 pounds which consisted of thre layers of dry toast, dry",Date of stay: August 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Amazing location. Amazing lobby.,"3 nights, standard double room, no window, no breakfast.  Pros: (1) Canary Wharf is so cool district. You can fully enjoy the modern feel of London. Heron's Quay is more close, by the way. (2) Free, unlimited and fast wifi in the lobby. It is very useful for uploading your 100++ photos per every day to the cloud storage. (3) Room is wide. Full-size bathtub is included. Shower water pressure is good. (4) Look for Tesco Metro near Canary Wharf underground station. Amazing deals.  (5) Only 6 DLR(light railway) stations away from the Bank of England. Amazing location, really. In addition, Greenwich is also close :)  Cons: (1) No slipper or flip-flop provided. You have to bring your own. Also, you have to request  toothpaste from the front desk. (2) British TV channel sucks. No joke.",Date of stay: August 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Apalling hotel,"An old, tired, grubby hotel not worth the premium you have to pay due to its location.  Staff can barely speak English, only 20 minutes of free wifi in a £180 room (is this 1999?), 15 year old TVs that drop in and out of reception (some face away from you too due to the shape of the rooms), shower runs boiling then freezing, awful beds, DLR runs next to your window all night. Plug sockets next to the bed are foreign!? So if you live in 2017 and want to charge your phone next to where you sleep forget it, it'll be the other side of the room in the wobbly socket next to the knackered dressing table.  They care only about money, everything has a premium, £5 to deliver poor quality room service, £50 to check out early? £4 to use the gym that closes before the times advertised in the",Date of stay: August 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Average,"We stayed in the Britannia international as the prices were good. But to be honest we kinda wished we stayed at the novo hotel across the road. The Britannia hotel has a lovely interior with beautiful chandeliers and 'old style' or Victorian decor, this is what swayed our decision to stay here. Although the hotel has a nice decor it is out dated like many of the other reviews mentioned. We had an issue checking in which was in the end a 3rd party error not the hotels (hotel never received the booking) the rooms were nice, basic hotel room really with all accessories included. Shower gel, soap, tea, coffee iron and hair dryer. We paid for room and breakfast. The breakfast I wouldn't recommend tbh.

Can't complain.......,"The good Lady and I visited last night using a Groupon voucher for £78 including breakfast and a bottle of wine. Parking was £21 for 24hrs but your not going to find cheaper in this area so can't complain. Now speak as I find we were on the 12th floor, huge room with double jacuzzi bath and great views. The room was clean and tidy all be it a little worn. Breakfast was a buffet set up which was fine not Michelin star again nothing to complain about. Staff were accommodating and efficient. We didn't see any mice, we didn't get food poisoning, we didn't stick to any carpets and enjoyed our stay. It is only a 5 minute stroll from all the buzz of the Canary Wharf area.

Cheap but terribly tired,"Stayed a few times as it is cheap. That's about where the good news ends. Very tired decor, fraying at most corners and incredibly dated.

Croissant could have floated mid air it was so dry. Yoghurt like water. Breakfast staff poor to attend to you...we always had to ask them for cups etc as they never came to us. They even tried to give us an old coffee pot from the next table. To top it off, you get charged extra for the (very small) swimming pool and towels from pool and the jacuzzi was not working.

DO NOT book this place.,"Booked this place ( so called hotel) for one night, as some reviews say it's very dated and there not wrong. Staff were not helpful one little bit and after complaining about MICE running around the bar area didn't seem to bothered, probably because they have had that many complaints before, especially from another guest as I was complaining.

Excellent weekend away,"Together with other members of our family we visited the Britannia International Hotel for a weekend away. The hotel was comfortable and the staff were helpful and friendly, the food was good and the drinks were all reasonable priced. The only downside was that the hotel is somewhat dated in appearance and located in an area where major construction projects are currently in progress. On the whole, it was a most enjoyable long weekend break, that represented good value for money.",Date of stay: August 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Fantastic,To be honest I've stayed in a few Britannia hotels and they have always been fairly budget. We picked this deal up on a website for one night.

Find somewhere else to stay,Find somewhere else to stay! This is the worst hotel I have ever been I have been in a lot of hotels for a cheaper price an this one and it's been much better quality.  We stayed half-board the food was not interesting  at all and not much  variety . The home-made puddings was stodgy andedible.  The bathroom plug didn't work and was on able to let out the water from the bath and this was meant to be the top price room.  Would never go here again !,Date of stay: August 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Good not great,I stayed here for three days and two nights. My biggest complaint is the wifi. It is only available for free in the public places like the lobby. They give you 20 min for free in your room. There were no outlets near my bed so I had to charge my things on the other side of the room. The hotel has a old fashioned style. The breakfast and dinner were good. It's a bit of a strange walk to the metro. You have to walk over a small bridge. I didn't like the surrounding area. Not much to do or see. I wouldn't stay again.,Date of stay: August 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Good standrd hotel in Canary Wharf,"Stayed for 2 nights & was given a room upgrade upon check in, result.

Great for the price,"Excellent service, staff couldn't be more helpful, downstairs in the foyer was very 4*, however the rooms were more tired yet a decent size, nice and clean.  Breakfast was Ok, all self service for those on Half Board, food was constantly being replenished, great selection with plenty of hot and cold food to choose from, (Just watch the fried eggs), oh and don't be surprised with the chips being out for breakfast, apparently the chinese guests like that. Dinner again self service, was selection of carved meat with rice, veg, fish dish, selection of deserts, apple pie & Custard or rice pud being our favourites, but cheescakes and chesse with crackers selection are available too.

Management needs retraining,"Went with National Holiday's and to be fair you get what you pay for. We were there for the Wembley weekend and it did us fine. Yes it needs a refit and yes the food could be  better. For what we paid it was a fair deal.  My problem was with one of the jumped up manager's. He met us off the bus on Friday 25th teatime. He ran through procedures and told us dinner would be at 6.30 and breakfast 7.30. Let's get this right. I had been up at 5am on the Friday, the thought of a lay in till about 8am was dismissed by this so called management. We were sat having. A quiet drink in the lounge relaxing after being in the worse traffic jams the coach driver had ever seen in London.

Past its sell by date,"We stayed here 5 years ago when we were attending the Olympic Games. Unfortunately nothing seems to have been done to it during that time. The area currently has a lot of building work going on so unfortunately the views are not as nice as they were. The bar and lobby area are pleasant enough and so are the staff. In fact the entrance gives a false sense of grandeur! But the rooms (though spacious) are tired, old fashioned and shabby. And I'm not quite sure about the  whimsical pictures of young ladies with petticoats on the walls!? Beds are small and old. The air con juddered and creaked. Toilet flush was poor.

Sound but a little tired,We stayed here as part of a National Holidays coach party and the outside is impressive. Old world charm and ornamentation. Decent food for both dinner and breakfast.

"The room was basic and dirty, and the receptionist was rude!","Upon entering the room, the carpet needed hoovering and was badly stained. I picked screwed up wrappers from under one of the beds - presumably left by the previous occupant. The room was large but very basic and in dire need of refurbishment. The glasses in the bathroom were right next to the toilet and behind the bin. Grossly unhygienic. When I explained the above and asked to change room, the receptionist replied 'it's because you booked a room with a window'. There was no apology. I was shown a room with a window to which I could upgrade for a fee. I decided not to and booked an alternative hotel for the second night, thus losing the money I had paid to Britannia.

"Friendly staff, old chique hotel needs some upgrades to the 21st century","I arrived a little early. No problem, my original room was not ready yet, but I got another room which was already cleaned and ready to be rented out again. I took this room, dropped of my luggage and went on to explorer the city again.  The staff advised me to buy my breakfast the evening before, because that is cheaper than buying it the morning itself, which I did.  The room was tidy and clean, though a little bit oldfashioned. I'm sure this must have been a really chique hotel in the early days, but for today it is old.

Prebooked parking around a 20 minute walk away as a parking space was not guaranteed due to not being able to pre-book , so it was a bit of a walk. In hindsight there probably was a parking space but it was not worth the risk of having nowhere to park in London after driving a while. No issues with the room initially, it was comfy albeit a little dated. Went to the Britney concert no issues and had a few drinks. Returned to the hotel ready to sleep after a long night out.

The food was pretty reasonable, self service breakfast, but evening meal, the main joints of meat were dished out and the portions were quite small.

Very disappointing,Where to start with comments on this hotel? Perhaps with the positives:  There are a couple of lovely people on Reception. The barrage of complaints they receive would undermine the most resilient however I did not hear a disrespectful comment from them at all despite the many complaints they were receiving. The two ladies in the Bar/Lounge area are also a credit to the business. An Americano with cream on the side was no problem for them. The Underground is only about 500metres away. That’s where the positives end.

The pool and gym are closed, but you can go running along the river on the nearby Thames Path, which is way better.  For £52 for a single, I don't see how you could do any better.

Needs a massive update,This hotel is Very very run down. Mouldy curtains and stains on the wall - cleaners stated it was just damp - which is not healthy if this is the case. Everything is needing to be replaced. There is an old feel to everything in the room. It is very much needing some TLC.  Very minimal security present - we took all our valuables with us most times we left.  Staff are very unenthusiastic - won’t get much out of them  20 mins of free wifi a day which is totally average considering what you pay for.  I’d pay more money for a nicer hotel.,Date of stay: August 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Needs work!,"Booked last minute  to watch the boxing. Got a twin room for a good price of £84. Close to the underground, hotel looked ok and the shower was amazing (probably the best thing about the room) - but that's where the pros stopped. Very tired rooms, checking in took forever, the rooms smelt funny, we had a vent directly outside our window that made a buzzing noise all night, so we had to close the window...but it didn't close properly! And the beds, were probably the worst beds I have ever slept on, and I travel for work and stay in budget hotels, to glam hotels...these beds were awful! I'd have given this hotel 1 star, but I feel the shower deserved a star on it's on!

Not impressed at all,"We'd been to a concert & we were very tired, we just wanted to get to our room. There were 6 staff,  at the desk a queue of tired people & only one person checking us in.. the others were faffing around with paperwork. It took ober half hour before we could check in. I've been all over the world & never have I had to wait that long. The room was passable but not special, the bed was uncomfortable, the air con didn't work & we were too tired to go down & sort it out. I was also very surprised at the cheap tea & coffee they supplied as well, I don't mind unbranded stuff but they tasted horrible & no biscuits... not even cheap ones.

PLEASANT SURPRISE,"We recently stayed at this hotel for two nights ( before we read the reviews), we did not know what to expect as the reviews were terrible.  As we arrived at the hotel we were surprised, as a reviewer had commented about the ""creepy"" chandeliers, we actually thought they looked quite elegant, yes the check in was quite slow, but to be fair there seems so much paper work the check in staff have to complete.  We were asked if we would like to upgrade out room, the member of staff explained how much extra it would cost, and we agreed.  The room was on the 11th floor, as we walked in there was a black spiral staircase which lead to a large room with floor to ceiling windows.

Went into the room to find only 3 beds supplied and one window completely smashed with a plastic film on it. Absolutely not acceptable. Staff at front desk changed our room to a room with 4 beds in.

The place is generally worn down and very dated, the rooms very similar but for the price and location some things can be excused. However on my last visit which will be my last we were given a room with no window, no problem however the air intake was clearly not working which meant the room peaked at 35 degrees, this is not acceptable and we were offered.

Weekend from hell,"Our weekend didn’t start too well anyway due to protests in London. We had spent 9 hours in the car. When we got there, it took an hour to check in and they tried to make us pay twice. The room had illegal plug sockets and we were out of there as quickly as possible. The food was simply but they only had one option which meant that when we didn’t like the food or couldn’t have it, we had to go out and spend more money. It’s a very out of date hotel and then they charged me £25 parking in what I can only describe as an underground dump. My car came out with 2 scratches due to what I can only presume was cars not having enough room to move in there. Overall, not a great place for any type of visit.

The dinner was absolutely wonderful.  Apple crumble with custard for dessert.  Reminded me of my dear mum when I was a kid.  Meat every night or salad for veggies.  Please keep the food the same.

From the outside and lobby it looked fairly impressive, but after  queuing for 40 minutes to check-in all the while watching reception staff sitting chatting in plain view I started to get a feeling that perhaps customer service and quality wasn't going to be the best (yes the staff could have been on a break but if so perhaps they should move out of sight because it's just rubbing salt in the wound of the customers who were waiting for such a ridiculously long time ).

After a relatively trouble free journey from Leeds, we arrived in the West End of London and to our complete amazement, the driver stopped and parked outside Park Lane's, Grosvenor Hotel.

Avoid ! Simple as that !,"There is not a single aspect of my stay that I enjoyed! 4 stars misleading, much more like 2. If you still have to come, avoid the smoking rooms - they don't have opening windows ( you need to ask staff to come and open it ), unlikely that they have air extract grilles, or if they do, they didn't work, and the smell is toxic and unbearable - all the 2nd floor smells like that, and of cheap detergent. Forget about quality, beds are atrocious, furniture tries to be retro but only succeeds in being deteriorated, plastic and ugly. YOU HAVE TO PAY £7/DAY EXTRA FOR LOW SPEED INTERNET !! Don't try the burgers in the Italian restaurant - they are a combination of dog meat paste and cheap spices. Thank god, I don't know about the rest.

It was then moved onto a table by the elevator, but it was left there for 2 DAYS!!! The smell in the area and along the corridor was unbearable.

Central BUT tired & dates,"Stayed here for two nights with some colleagues attending a charity event. The hotel is in the heart of Canary Wharf & close to the DLR, so transport isn't a problem, especially if flying into City Airport. The hotel is very very dated with rooms looking like the pub in 1980s TV's Minder. The hotel is cheaper than those around it and you pay for what you get. Thought £4 plus £1 for towel hire a bit steep for use of the pool, one would have thought it free for residents, but sadly not. Didn't eat here as there are lots of places to eat in Canada Square, so we did that and enjoyed people watching. Would we stay here again?

PLEASE READ MY REVIEW,"I booked a week before coming with National Holidays. Paid £99.00 for myself, £74.00 for my 11 year old son. That was to include coach down and 2 nights breakfast and evening meal. Not bad for a pre Christmas treat.   After booking I checked Trip advisor for reviews. Straight away I was alarmed by horrendous reviews about hotel. All the journey here I was worried.  Arrived here, the concierge boarded bus, and introduced himself, handed the keys and card to visit restaurant.  Went straight to room and was immediately impressed.

Room full of flies vs Sweaty Sauna Room,"I will not be staying here again. This 4* star hotel appears atheistically pleasing as you enter the building. Our first room was filled with flies which is unacceptable  regardless of room price. In addition to this, I had been travelling all day with two young children, so the fact I had to ring reception at 9.30pm to complain about the flies was appalling. After being promised an immediate call back and the manager promising to view the room, we had to call reception and chase them up ourselves. They decided they did not want to send the manager and asked us to go down to reception to change room keys and move rooms. We moved to a room which was a downgrade, which I may add we were not refunded for.

Shabby but not chic.,This was a very cheap hotel. Only £99 for one night. I think we got an upgrade to the penthouse floor and the views were fabulous but the decor was strange. Awful outdated furniture and substantial damage to the wallpaper in the bedroom. Dreadful pictures but the room was very spacious with a sofa and nice-sized TV. The only good point that I can give I think.The worst beverage tray I have ever seen. 2 coffees and 2 teas. It said that you could ask for more but it doesn't give a very good impression. The bathroom had many issues. There was discoloured wallpaper peeling off the walls and the tiles had been stained by damp. The worst thing of all was that it was really dirty. The taps were foul. I polished a bit of one just out of interest to see if it could be done. It could. I,Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Terrible Accommodation,"I paid £149 for a room at Britannia International which was terrible value for money.  The room had no windows, which i was warned about, but it was a wheelchair accessible room which i was not informed about, this meant the toilet was high and lidless and very close to the sink which was unpleasant.  The sink was too low for a standing guest.  The room decor was grim, the bath had an old fashioned shower curtain, the towels were small and rough, there was brown tape on the ceiling holding a vent in place and the worst horror was an appalling smell from the bathroom.  I asked to be moved and was offered either another disabled room without a bad smell or a room with no air flow that was as hot as a sauna.

Tired rooms but nice reception area,"Stayed here for a mini break as part of a coach trip. Great location for exploring Canary Wharf and can get DLR / tube to all around London.  Sitting having breakfast and looking over the water was a nice experience and the cooked breakfast was good. The evening meal sadly wasn't. Not a great deal of choice of food for such a large hotel.   Rooms were very tired. Windows were locked and we had no view, just a brick wall which was disappointing as considering the great location we had hoped to have a view from the room. Cobwebs on curtains and room seemed in need of a bit of a clean and an update. Beds not particularly comfy but only staying 2 nights so it wasn't a massive issue.

I asked for a new room which was better. The two rooms i had need redecorating. The towels were not big enough. £4 to use the gym as a resident is not good value and doesn't open till 7am,so no good if you are trying to fit a session in before work. The £10 breakfast buffet is not worth it,flasks of hot  drinks on your table and the buffet was very poor and unappetising,  so i left it. recommend you spend £10 outside the hotel where there are many places in walking distance.

Where do I start ?,"My, my, my, where do I start ? -  I came with a tour group and when we arrived at the hotel, we all huddled around the lobby at check in and the manager came out and gave a little speech about the hotel. Very difficult to understand and very broken English.    Speaking of food –  Breakfast, OMG! The eggs still had that runny portion of the eggs floating on top of them in the tray, disgusting.  Then there was a tray with gray stuff in it, and thought it was oatmeal. NOT!, it was scrambled eggs.  I have never in my lifetime EVER seen gray scrambled eggs.

Will never stay here again.,"This is no disrespect to the gentleman who spent three days at this hotel between Christmas and New Year, but obviously at a little less than £40 per night for bed, breakfast and dinner, in London (£119 for three days all inclusive, he states) you cannot expect 5 star luxury.  However, for those who spent considerably more for a 3 night stay (almost double the price he paid) I feel we have a right to make constructive criticism. The hotel is what it is, a typical coach tour hotel.  Where every three days the client base changes, and therefore the rooms get well used, and are therefore well worn.

Wouldn't recommend,"Booked this hotel for a mini xmas break with my boyfriend, nothing was terrible but it wasnt amazingly great either. If paying by cash there is a £50 deposit ontop the only reason why we were going to pay cash is because we were told over the phone that you could not pay by contactless. When we got there they said we could in the end. Booked a city room, so expected a window with some sort of view. Instead we got a room with no windows and felt very boxed in. The beds are terrible, hard and uncomfortable. The room gets very hot and you have no window to get some fresh air in. The wifi is not available throughout the hotel, ONLY in the lobby area.

"You only get what you pay for, why complain??","It really annoys me when people expect a top hotel for minimal cost, we have just had 2 nights on a national holidays deal, £119 including coach travel, half board excellent value. Yes the hotel is a long way from the heart of London, but a short walk and you can get the jubilee line or DLR. The hotel requires tarting up, but the staff we met were very helpful and polite, the food was fine, with great buffet breakfast each morning. The room was large and kept spotlessly clean, the hotel does not warrant the very negative reviews previously displayed, this certainly was not our perception, it's only the location that would prevent me staying again.",Date of stay: December 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
‘Spa’ Access & Afternoon Tea Avoid!,"Whilst this hotel looks quite grand, I’m sure it once was it is now very tired and dated. We didn’t stay but went for the day. The views from the lounge are nice, across the water at Docklands. I visited with a friend and our two 11 year old daughters for a special meet up. When accessing the ‘spa’ (which isn’t what I’d class as a spa), we were only allowed a small towel each. As I’d checked beforehand in case we needed to bring any I was surprised when asking for a second towel to dry hair that there was a charge of £3 per towel.

A MOUSE IN MY ROOM !!!!!!,"I've written various reviews of this hotel following my many stays before.  When I work in london it's very convenient and although definitely not 4* it usually does the job although a heater is required in the room in winter. Last week however just after I checked in and went to my room I was horrified to see a mouse run across the floor and out under the door!  When I looked in the corridor the mouse was no where to be seen so presumably it had entered another room. Naturally I returned to reception and a horrified receptionist provided me with another room (11 floors below) and gave me a voucher for 1 drink.  The manager was called and he too apologised and, as far as the hotel was concerned, that was it.  Not good enough really! Beware if you ever stay here!!!!!!!!!!

"A peculiar hotel, but nice none-the-less","Reception is large and spacious, check-in fast and efficient.  My room was huge, enough to easily hold a full size mahogany dining table with 6 chairs and also a full size cabinet against the wall, at the end of the bed was a large sofa too. I would guess the room was once a smoking room and the smell was a bit strong, I'm a non-smoker so for be it was just about tolerable. As previous reviews have stated, the rooms are a bit tired now, but come across as being a little quirky especially given it's ultra-high tech location, surrounded by glass and chrome buildings.

Afternoon tea for two is a rip off,"Came for afternoon tea today, absolutely vile.   Stale bread, 8 tiny sandwiches that wouldn't satisfy a child, a small pot of jam for two scones, and frozen/stale cakes. Not to mention there was an uneven number of cakes for two so it's a good thing we didn't want to eat them!  Sandwiches were more pickle than cheese and I've never had such tasteless salmon before  Service was also very poor, she was clearly unhappy to serve us and explicitly said she was very busy despite the bar area appearing pretty empty.   We were asked what tea we wanted and met with a disgruntled look when we asked what was the option.

"Unfriendly management, cold rooms, dated decor","I'll start with a short summary: don't stay at this hotel unless all others in the area are fully booked on the nights you want to stay (as was the case for us).  We decided to combine a night at a show in the O2 with an overnight stay in a hotel in the Canary Wharf area, mainly for the convenience and also as we'd had good experiences with other hotels in the same area in the past. At the time we booked, availability at hotels other than the Britannia was very limited, so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived around 4pm on the day of the show, where the receptionist ""upgraded"" us to a larger room. When we went up to the room, it felt rather cold (13°C to be precise), so we bumped up the heating to a target temperature of 25°C and went back out on our way for an evening of",Date of stay: December 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

a great disappointment - the only good point was the price,A very sad hotel even though it is in the middle of the modern docklands.

This hotel needs a lot of love - even the staff obviously  had no pride as the hotel is is so run down. I member of staff stepped out of the lift in front of use leaving 2 beer bottles on the lift floor. Parking is a joke too - the car park is very tight and with a strong smell of canabis. We paid for parking but no places were available so had to park in an NCP carpark nearly a miles walk away. Not good with a lot of heavy suitcases.

I question some of the other negative reviews as they all got a discounted price so surely you realise in advance this is because the hotel hasnt recently spent millions on a refurb.

"Ideal Location, shame about Hotel","Visited London late December 2018 and stayed for 4 nights at the Britannia Canary Wharf. One of the plus points was the hotel is close to rail station for access anywhere you would like to go. The hotel is probably typical of all Britainnia hotels, once great but now in great need of refurbishment. The rooms in need of decoration and modernisation and the air con regardless of what setting you gave it was always cold, but on the plus side beds were generally clean and comfortable. My wife and I found the food to be adequate and eatable with no complaints, where as the bar and area was shoddy and armchairs patched up with gaff tape, the biggest complaint was the Staff who we found to be arrogant and unwelcoming TO ALL customers.

The room was adequate at best the bed was terrible we were given 2 small towels. I slept for about half hour because of all the noise . The spice Indian restaurant was horrendous the staff didn’t even ask us if we wanted another drink after waiting 40 minutes for our food with a basically empty restaurant.

Ignore this at your own peril!!,"Before staying at this hotel, I decided that I would form my own opinion despite what other reviews said. Big mistake. I came to London with my mam for a nice pre-Christmas break, shopping and sightseeing. The hotel's proximity to the DLR and the underground station are it's only saving graces. The hotel itself looks lovely from the outside, but it's like stepping inside a time warp where nothing really flows cohesively. The first shocker was that you have to pay £7 per day per device for Wi-Fi!!! The staff (except for one chef who always said hello with a smile) are disinterested and, at times, rude. We went into the Friday's bar on Saturday evening which was quiet, but pleasant.

Poor value for money in this Britannia International Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for one night only during a business trip. I guess I'm not expecting too much when staying in a hotel for one night, but this place is really not worth the price that they put on the bill.  A few things that I noticed during my stay: -  It appears that the hotel (including the rooms) needs some serious renovation, as pretty much everything has a very used look and feel to it.  - Breakfast is ok but quite basic.  - First thing to do at the reception is pay the bill upon arrival. Reception staff was comparably unfriendly in my opinion.  - WiFi is free for only 20 minutes. After that it is 7GBP per device.

Walked in a restaurant and checked where my booking was, after speaking to the main manager in the Hotel, (food & beverage manager) in respect to booking a table, I realised that the booking was never made, not a major problem due to lots of empty tables and not cleared accordingly.

Clean Budget Hotel,"Having read some bad reviews l have to say l was nervous about this hotel.  Yes, the rooms are tired and the mattress wasn't luxurious. However, the room was clean and l slept well, so the bed was obviously comfortable enough.  Check in was okay and the concierge was excellent at ordering us a taxi. Having not had time to eat before the theatre it was nice to come back to the hotel and have something to eat without any fuss, plus with other guests arriving back it was a nice atmosphere, finishing the evening off nicely. Only criticism was that the bar was closed for a private function, so to buy a drink had to get one from the 'coffee bar', where the staff were not the best, slow and not really competent.

Disgraceful,"Worst night's stay. Firstly, after going out and arriving back late in the evening, my bed was absolutely soaking wet as a result of a dripping leak from the ceiling. After going to reception to tell them about this, the lobby staff firstly looked disinterested and didn't seem to believe me, instead they were too focussed on what to do with a stranger sleeping on the lobby sofa. After continuous reassurance that there was definitely a leak in my bed, I was moved to a moved smaller room. Unfortunately, when it came to having a shower in the morning, there was no hot water coming out of the shower. I left this for a while to see if it would eventually warm up but to no avail, meaning I could not shower in my room that morning. I emailed the hotel about this back in December but",Date of stay: December 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
"Functional, if somewhat dated.",Pros- The staff were friendly and food was of a decent quality with a good choice of dishes. The hotel is very close to Canary Wharf tube station and is straight forward to find.   Cons- The mattress was very worn and uncomfortable with little in terms of pillows to support our necks. The hotel is in need of refurbishment like many Britannia hotels but is sufficient as a budget option.

Just about Ok,"Well I needed a room in London for a night after Football. This hotel, which I knew as I used to live in the area, seemed OK value - £125 a night - no breakfast. I guess for London it was sort of OK. However, in the two years since I moved away from the area, it is basically now sitting in the middle of a building site - with access from Canary Wharf tube pretty tricky. Also I was in a basement with no windows and only 20 mins of free wi-if and pretty much no phone coverage. This was disappointing to say the least. If you are going to put people in a windowless basement- at least give them decent wi-if.

I’m trying to think of anything nice to say about the place and I’m afraid I can’t.    It describes itself as a modern hotel.  Modern for a time traveller from 1980, which was probably when it was last decorated and cleaned.  The check in is slow - don’t know why they needed my driver licence number.  I stay in lots of hotels and that’s a first !  I had an Executive room - well I pity the people who had rooms of a lower class than mine.  I could feel the springs on the bed.

Twixtmas trip with National Holidays,"We booked this trip with National Holidays and knew it was a very good price, so our expectations of the hotel were not 4 star.

The hotel check in for the groups ( there were 3 coaches) was swift and planned well ahead.   The rooms were spacious, clean ( a bit of dust here and there, but certainly not dirty) however, it seems it’s not been redecorated at all since the mid 90’s.

Colleague got their manager, he told me to read the notice from the police that makes it clear. I read the note, still wasn’t clear why they needed it.   Asked for clarification and they wouldn’t let me check in unless I provided it, were rude about it too. Said that they needed it just in case I committed a crime or in case I was a victim of a crime.

Ok as a base,Visited last london last weekend and stayed at the Brittania on a bed breakfast evening meal basis with my children. The rooms were comfortabke and clean although a little dated but nothing to complain about. Was a great base to stay as only 10/15 minutes into central london on the tube from canary wharf station and a 5 minute walk to that. Unfortunately food wasnt of the greatest standard. Breakfast was basic but ok and suited all of the family. Unfortunately evening meals weren't good at all very bland and of poor quality. On the second evening of our stay we used the pizzeria within the hotel at extra cost. This was nice and enjoyed by all. Would stay here again due to the ease of getting into London but would only use as accomodation.,Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Pleasant one night stay,"I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel. This was the closest hotel left with availability to the O2 on short notice and although it is in need of refurbishment, it was very clean and the staff were polite and friendly. We booked a room with no window (as that was all we could see online) and on check-in, were upgraded to a room with a window (bonus, nice view of the O2). Due to time restraints, we ate in the pizzeria and were really disappointed with the food. Be aware if travelling for an event, there are lots of road closures and it is difficult for taxis to access.",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
pleasantly suprised!,"I was sceptical of staying here after reading some of the reviews but was surprised at how nice it was, my only complaint was that the food was the same two nights in a row with dry chicken :( but my son and I loved the breakfast with lots of choice! would definately stay again and the cleaners were fab!!!!",Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
RATS! RUDE and avoid!!!!,The staff.  We called the hotel ahead of our arrival to ask if there was parking. We were told their was. What we wasn't told was it was £42!!!!!! So upon arrival we were met with a £42 parking fee in a non secure car park!  We tried to speak to the duty manager who was absurdly rude.  He spoke to us with no respect and told us if we didn't like the parking cost we could leave! We were in complete shock. He was so rude. We are very well travelled and have never encountered such rudeness.  We also found the rooms dirty! Hairs in the bed. Wall paper hanging off. Unkept carpet.  Now for the grand finally ..... Rats!!!!! There were 2 rats that we saw on separate occasions and in different parts of the hotel.  My advice - avoid this pit of a hotel.,Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

We went down for breakfast at 10am ( finished at 10.30) we were completely ignored and left to our own devices- the buffet was sparse to say the least- manky bacon , rock hard scrambled eggs , burnt sausages and no harsh browns.

Terrible Hotel with really unhelpful staff.,"On arrival we were shocked to be charged  £20 for a window. My not so beautiful view was the Novetel Hotel oppersite and the roof. Not really the panoramic views of London that was promised in the brochure. The food in the evening wasn't great. The breakfast coffee was disgusting. Served in blue dirty plastic jugs. Far too strong to drink. The milk jug was also dirty. The carpet had potato on the floor from the night before. Really nasty. The room was ok but the bath not only had hair on it, it also had a ring from the previous guests shower gel.

"Where to start....Well, let's start anywhere but this hotel!",I booked this hotel as it was close to central London and was competitive to the usual Travelodge/Premier Inn options. The photos on the website made it look grand...and I can't lie. First impressions upon walking in backed up that thought. Scratch under the surface and it's a totally different story.   So...let's try and put a fair review together...  1. Check in was smooth and receptionist was polite. Very keen to push upgrades and breakfast. We had booked £65 room (no window) and added £10pp breakfast after being offered it.   2. The room looked clean but due to lack of window it felt very claustrophobic. It was very basic and VERY small. Advice: pay for the upgrade to room with window!!!  3. Upon return from the theatre we got back and used the bar. Staff could barely crack,Date of stay: February 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

It was so hot! Uncomfortably hot. We tried to turn the heat down but it was broke. The air con was so loud and made no difference to the temperature.  The bed was two single beds pushed together which were very uncomfortable.  The towels had stains on. The plug in the bath and the sink was broken. Had the worst nights sleep ever!

Would make a great 3 star...! (If you sort kitchen problems),"OK it IS cheap (travel from Yorkshire plus dinner, b&b and breakfast for £70ish per head). But if you are going to market it as a 4* then ensure that it is up to snuff. Tired hotel stuck in the 1990s, very clean but packed with foreign staff (not all had a great command of English).  The room was tired, tatty in places, but very clean.  The evening all you can eat buffet offered: Stilton & broccoli soup, cold salmon & salad, roast gammon, Mexican beef, mushroom stroganoff, cheese & biscuits and 3 desserts. It was all very fresh, the apple cake was gorgeous. But the rest was rather Bland. For the price there is no cause to complain, but nothing is labeled. The staff can barely understand you so trying to find out what anything is, is impossible.

3 Nights of disgust,"Dirty crockery, dirty remotes control dirty phone, buttons so crammed with dirt they wouldn’t work. Beds like prison bunks. Complained and got moved to the “new” part of the hotel. It’s was newer but definitely not new. The AC is on permanently in winter too.  Bed  linen was grey and the quilts - yuk.

Another Lovely Stay,The staff were very friendly making it very easy and quick to check in. The hotel lobby is an excellent place to people watch and relax on one of the comfy sofas whilst enjoying a drink from one of the bars.

I didn't try any of the restaurants, so I can't comment, but I had a drink in the bar overlooking the water and the former wharfs, which was fine.  The gym was also well equipped along the swimming pool is a little small for swimming lengths.

Windows were dirty and you could hardly see the views mentioned on the website.  Frankly not sure how they can claim their star rating and charge as much as they do.

Disappointing,"The hotel looks very grand and modern from the outside but seems to be the opposite on the inside. Our room had a spiral staircase going up to the bedroom and bathroom. It was a nice touch but seemed unneeded. The decor was quite dated but the room was huge.  The tele was miles away from the bed so quite hard to see properly and there was no free wifi, which, in London seems unheard of.  The spa is extremely dated and is indeed of a dire touch up and clean. No stairs to get into the hot tub and no shallow end to the pool. Didn't stay in there long!  We had a groupon voucher which included dinner and breakfast. One of the restaurants was closed so we was only able to go to the pizzeria, fine, who doesn't like pizza.

Disappointing but cheap and cheerful!,"Visited this hotel several times about 20 years ago when it must have been in its hey day. Today it appears to be very tired and old fashioned, I don't think a penny has been spent on the place in all those years. Having said that the room was clean and presentable. We used the spa which is the nicest part of the hotel. The girls doing our treatments were very nice. The most disappointing thing was the food. The evening meal was a mismatch of dishes, all tasteless. The waiter questioned our 'free bottle of wine with meal' deal which was very unprofessional. Breakfast was better though and it has to be said that the waterside location of the dining area is lovely.

Fading glory,"I've stayed here a couple of times in the past, once when the hotel was nearly new back in the 90's and also a couple of years ago. This particular time, I picked the place from our corporate travel system because everywhere else was punishingly expensive and the Britannia popped up a half decent rate.  The hotel is in the heart of the docklands a few minutes walk from South Quay DLR station and is in an early 90's building from the time when angular brown fake granite faced buildings were the fashion.

I recently had a 4 night stay at the Britannia and enjoyed it very much.,I was on a 5 day National Holidays London Spectacular.  Had a single room at the Britannia and it was perfect. Very spacious and clean and I was lucky to have a view of the water and Canary Wharf.   Breakfast and dinner was served buffet style with an excellent choice and all well cooked. That was provided free for me. Otherwise you'd have to pay about £12 for one meal. Staff were friendly and at reception they were always helpful with enquiries.  I was very pleased with my stay there and so were other people I met on the coach. So I don't know why there are some people here on Tripadvisor giving the hotel bad reviews.  It was great for me.

Traditional would be a compliment..tired and dates is more appropriate.    The decor in this hotel is pretty awful and the service matches it.  The check in process was poor with no interaction whatsoever.  Wifi is charged at £7 per day which these days is poor.  All of the furniture in the room was damaged or marked and there was damp patches on roof and walls.  Air con did not work, both hot or cold and the shower was basically a mist, rather than jest of water.  Wallpaper coming off walls.

More than I expected,"I recently stayed here with my wife for 1 night half board. The food in the Spindles Resturant was good for a buffet. Breakfast was also good with very nice bacon! Staff we encountered were all very pleasant and helpful. This was probably a 4 star hotel once but sadly it is a bit tired in places and could do with a bit of a refit but you get what you pay for. Another plus with this hotel were the bar prices. I paid £4.10 for a pint of San Miguel which is cheaper than my local pub!

Shame the evening meals weren't the same, very disappointed with the food offered, even running out of food at 7:30 pm and not being replaced, restaurant advertised it closed at 9:30 pm last orders 9:00 pm. Bedrooms are clean albeit could do with a refurbish. Tea and Coffee in rooms with extras available via reception no bother. Concierge was very helpful with travel arrangements to get to the Theatre.

WORSE THAN PRISON. RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE YOU HATE!!!!!,"My boyfriend and me went to the Britannia for a treat. He preferred the time he spent at her majesty's pleasure. My boyfriend said IN PRISON THERE WAS HOT WATER. Because on this day, even after moving our rooms to fob us off, the manager admitted that the hot water was not working in the hotel. He said that maintenance did not work on Sundays, and there was nothing we could do except use cold water. When we were moved rooms, we were moved to a much more tatty, damaged room, you can see in photos. The decor looked as if it had not been changed in about 40 years. It it abnormal that wifi is not included, it is very expensive.  We also smelt Cannabis coming from a room close to ours, and this was not the only place that stank of Cannabis.

"Awful Hotel, Don’t Stay Here!","Having stayed in numerous hotels, I have to say this ranks as one of the worst.

Comfortable but dated.,"Somewhat old-fashioned but the linen and bedding was very clean.  In some places it needed TLC as some of the lounge furniture relied on Duct tape to make it serviceable.  The staff were excellent and helpful.  Breakfast was generous and a good selection of typical British fare. An excellent location for the Quays shopping areas.  When new this would have warranted a higher rating.  I did notice, however, that there were some decorators in house, so things might be improving.

Dated,"Is it cheap for London, I don’t know? Is it dated, very. We did book one of the executive type rooms but no real science applied to this when we arrived and queued for ages to be given a pokey room with a view of a glass office block opposite. My husband stayed in reception to try and book the car parking as wi fi only works in the lobby unless your prepared to pay £7 a day for access in your room. Yes you have to add another £21 for parking. So not the executive box we booked so back to a long queue to ask to be moved. Eventually got a room on the 8th floor which was bigger but sad and tired. Ripped chair, filthy windows and bathroom a bit grotty. Other than that well located for Canary Wharf and tubes across London. Breakfast was well.

Abrupt and barely welcoming staff- with the main signs visible at reception being how they don’t tolerate abuse - so that’s the clientele here? All furniture dated and much dirty, chipped or broken. Bed splashed with some fluid - I’m not even going there... Fortunately bathroom clean if dated. Sink was vvvv slow to empty.

This is still advertised as available! Despite us getting a good deal on groupon it was the pool and spa that originally inspired this hotel. The food in the evening was basic but tasty and was perfectly adequate and the breakfast was also ok. Staff were not overly helpful when we asked if there were any other spas locally that we could use, the answer we were given was ‘I don’t know’ However, overall, a good price for what you get in a reasonable location if you can ignite the ripped chairs and tatty wallpaper.",Date of stay: February 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

False advertisement,"Myself and my partner booked this hotel as there was a offer on booking.com.  To say this was an ok night would be a stretch.   We booked into a double room and were met with a room whereby two singles were pushed together. The mattresses were different sizes, so the bed was uneven. There was a clear divide between the two beds, and a shared double fitted sheet could not disguise this.   My partner went to reception to report this and explain that we booked a double bed not twin room. The reception staff were very unhelpful and explained that’s how all the beds are, however if we wanted to pay £20 we could upgrade to a differnt bed.

This hotel has 2 bars and 2 restaurants (india and pizza). But again, you are at Canary Wharf you will find a lot of restaurants and bars as well.

I cleaned a patch with a wet wipe and voila it was actually sunny outside and not foggy! Wallpaper had stains on from where it looked like there had been a leak and dodmt smell very fresh at all.

I now know why! Paying £200 a night was murderous (my poor expenses!). The whole hotel has a musty smell. It’s horrifyingly outdated - decor, amenities and even receptions attitudes. Breakfast was poor too, so much so the 2nd morning I skipped it completely. Lots of building work outside hotel so noisy very early on. Next time there is nothing available I will stay further out and use the tube.

Partnering with criminal parking company,"We went to Britannia Hotel for a business meeting on February 2nd 2019 ,  Paid for the prepay  parking £6 , meeting ended  little late (15 min), came back and drove off, 4 weeks later received a hefty fine £100 by PARKINGEYE parking company, which Britannia Hotel is accommodating.  Apparently they have number recognition cameras which they apply fines automatically even if you are late few minutes. If this would be a normal parking facility where you could pay at the end, nobody would get this ridiculous  fines but then Britannia Hotel and its parking Partner PARKINGEYE would not make much more money (Parkingeye Gross Profit £20,987,962~) If Britannia Hotel wants to look after its customers , they should care more about how they get ripped of by its partners.",Date of stay: February 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

I knew this to be a street in busy Canary Wharf but as he did reassure that the room would be quiet, I agreed. However, it was noisy at night with traffic and people shouting from night’s out so did not get a good night’s rest.

Expensive WiFi in standard rooms.,"Whilst available free in the sterile environment of the lobby, wifi in  'standard' rooms is very expensive. Even Primark has free wifi nowadays  Added to the inadequacy of the heating system, the tepid shower water (worsens early as the morning goes on) and the paucity of the provision of tea and coffee making in the room made this a 'never again experience for me.",Date of stay: February 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Gosh how disappointing,"So, this was a romantic valentine's weekend so the expectations were high.  We had booked thro Booking.com who after the booking sent a confirmation saying it was a twin, windowless room.  Not the hotel's fault perhaps but not a good start.  We immediately wrote asking for this to be changed.  On check-in, even tho the hotel was far from full we were told it was a double room but without a window.  On entering the room it was freezing.  The radiator was off so we turned it on full but it was so small the room never warmed up.  Jumpers and flannel pyjamas only - ideal for valentine's (that's irony, or is it sarcasm?).  Anyway the bed was fine and the room and bathroom clean.  The duvet was paper thin so that didn't help the warmth.

Shabby and over priced,"Stayed at the Britannia hotel the foyer looked quite grand, the room cost £190 for one night and when I went into the room it had no window. Inside I found a room that was sad and run down.  It looked like it should have been ripped out and refurbished years ago.  The shower was a stand in the bath style with a material shower curtain. It was a cheap mattress I could feel the top of every spring sticking into my back. I could not get any reception for my mobile without having to go out into the corridor. when I complained I was informed that I could upgrade to a room with a window for an extra £10!!

We was well aware prices were more expensive whilst in London but paying almost £30 for 2 drinks was way over priced. We was given out room key and upon entering our room we was given for our full stay we was welcomed by green fluffy walls, body hair in the bed, carpet mites/moths that had eaten the carpet away which left holes and tears around the bedroom carpet, the heating was broken so was blowing out freezing cold air constantly, damp patches on the ceiling,",Date of stay: February 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

I booked room without window(?) but was checked in to the normal room on the 10th floor with huge window. Bed comfortable and linen clean. Bathroom good. Breakfast in the morning ok.

A good insight into 1990's wall street elte,"I was wondering how people were giving this hotel great reviews and after my first morning in the breakfast room on my first morning i understood why. The majority of the hotels clientele are over the age of 653 which obviously being that old have left their senses worse for ware. As the title of my post suggests,  the hotel gives a good insight into how the elite of wall street lived in the early 90's and is a fabulous testament to that era. I found it amazing how britannia and the staff have kept it in its period condition, well done guy's.

Don't be put off by some of the reviews.,"We stayed here for the weekend as part of a National Holidays’ coach tour. Reading several of the reviews, I was filled with some trepidation but my experience was not the one portrayed in some of the more negative reviews on here.   The bedroom was large, clean and the furnishings and fittings were of a high quality. We were on the 10th Floor and the views from our room and particularly the lift lobby were fantastic if cityscapes are your thing. A minor quibble is that there is no Wi-Fi in the rooms. There is in the hotel lobby though and I was able to pick it up in the restaurant as well.   Although it will be different for the independent traveller, people on coach tours are allocated a time slot for their breakfast and evening meal.

Good location for business but not for tourists. Outdated but clean & comfortable.,"Good business location 5 min walk from the dlr station. Comfortable beds. Bathrooms & room decor is outdated but clean. 2 perfectly average restaurants to choose from if you don't feel like venturing out. Staff are disinterested. Receptionist left me waiting for ages while she self importantly messed around with papers, stapling & reordering it! I was irritated that her paperwork was more important than letting me get to my room after my 12 hour working day! Couldn't she do that later? Checkout was slow too so leave plenty of time. There was a long queue at around 9am & they refuse to provide vat receipts on payment the evening before. So you all have to queue up in the morning for it. Daft process that!

Good points: impressive reception and foyer; very friendly and helpful staff; great view of Canary Wharf south dock from the restaurant; all you can eat buffet; late bar; big clean room; very comfortable bed.  Bad points: the room was freezing!

Handy for City Airport and that's about it,"Ended up staying here unexpectedly on a cold, foggy night when my flight and most other out of City airport we cancelled.  Big hotel but pretty soulless and very dated which seems to be on par with other hotels in the Britannia portfolio.  Room was big, very big actually but cold and dated.  Been a while since I've stayed in a room with a chintzy chandelier and flock wallpaper.  Both bars were cold, temperature wise, and unwelcoming in terms of ambience.  The staff were nice enough.  One poor girl behind the bar was stood in front of a two bar fire trying to keep warm and cheerful and I felt really sorry for her.  The Indian Restaurant within the hotel was a joke.

Not at all worth the money!,You are literally paying a premium to stay at Canary Wharf. The hotel is tired. The furniture in the bedroom is dark and badly scratched. The carpet is old and the bathroom looks grubby. I only tried one restaurant which was ok but nothing special. £150 and no breakfast! You even have to pay extra to use the leisure club!

Ok but definitely 3* not 4 or 5,This hotel is ok but nothing special. It certainly isn't a luxury 4* hotel as advertised but an adequate through over priced. 3*.  It's obviously had no refurbishment work done in years and looks very dated. As mentioned in earlier reviews everything costs extra.

Okay for one night,"I stayed here on Saturday evening as I was out with family and needed a place to crash. It's fine for one night. The hotel is super dated, and is in need of some much TLC with regards to decor. It doesn't look like it's been decorated since the Titanic. I had a pretty decent nights sleep, as the beds are comfortable, and my room was spacious enough, even for just one person. I do believe my brother and sister in law, had some issues regarding their room.  There's a lot of building works happening below the hotel so there's a substantial amount of noise in the early mornings from construction workers.   Location wise, it's good.

We ate at the pizzeria one night, which wasn't great. Very basic pizzas that appeared to be frozen. It was rather off putting to see the chef test the temperature of food by sticking his fingers in it (without gloves!)

On arrival we were immediately given an upgrade from a standard double room to a 'suite'. We went through our door to find a wrought iron spiral staircase, which while I accept wouldn't be to everyone's taste was very quirky. It led to a large room with a shared balcony overlooking Canary Wharf and a large bathroom with a jacuzzi bath much to my partner's delight!

On the plus side the wine that came with the offer was very good and the chef went out of his way to get my son some ice cream when none of the desserts on offer were to his liking.  The drinks in the hotel were reasonably priced but the appearence of a rat in the lounge did nothing to add to our experience.

Had a great stay,"I stayed at the Britannia International Hotel for six nights with my two cats as our house unexpectedly became uninhabitable. It is amazing that this hotel is so pet-friendly. I only had to pay a small upfront free (£20 per cat, I believe and a £50 deposit.)  The interior of the hotel could do with renovation, but in my room everything was in place and clean. Especially for the price. We had a very comfy stay. The 'old school' vibe of the hotel does have its charm. Breakfast was basic but fine. On our last night the file alarm went off at 6am (caused by another guest) but this was handled very elegantly by the staff. Reception staff was very helpful in general.   The only thing I would say is that there should be free WiFi in every room. It's 2018 :)",Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"Location great,  Hotel not great","The hotel is very near the Canary Wharf pier which was great for us as we had purchased an all day roamer ticket for the Thames river bus.  Great way to get around if you're wanting to visit the Tower, Westminster, London Eye, Greenwich etc. There is a lot of building work going on near the hotel which means that you can't use all the foot paths.    The hotel is very tired looking with old furniture and decor. Some of the furniture is ripped and patched with tape.  The carpets in the hallways are thread bare in places.  The room and bathroom were decent size and clean but again the room had very tired looking furniture.     The food was very basic with very little choice and it's all self service, even the water.

National Holidays,"Stayed here after booking a 3 day tour with national Holidays. The hotel is in an excellent location only a few miles from central London. The reception area is inviting and there is a nice bar looking out into the water. There is an Indian and Italian restaurant as well as another dining hall offering a variety of meals. The food was brilliant and self service. There was a large selection and it was all you can eat. Breakfast was great again a large selection. The hotel has a swimming pool, gym and spa which looked clean. The room was big and had all the facilities needed eg hairdryer, tv, desk,bath and shower. Very clean and good views from floor 8.

Needs a bit of money spending on it,Whilst my stay was faultless the hotel does need a bit of a tarting up.

"Nice hotel, pity about the food","Stayed 26th and 27th January and first im pessions were of a nice hotel if a little dated. This is a minor problem which Iam sure the hotel will be working on.National Holidays with whom I was travelling had requested a room on 1st floor, near lift as, being disa bled I would  not be able to manage stairs in an emergency. I was given  a room on 8th floor!! I immediately pointed out the inadvisability of this and to their credit they allocated me a room on 1st floor, room 102 which had a huge bed, french doors to a balcony overlooking the river.I believe this must have been one of the better rooms but nevertheless I was well pleased and notably the room was immaculately clean, also the bathoom. The room itself was very unadorned (no pictures) and there was no duvet on the bed",Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Overnight stay,"Was a bit worried after reading some reviews but needed not too .Hotel in great place for Canary Wharf.Booked a standed room no window,but on arrival upgraded to city view with window The hotel is old and the furniture is battered but it all was very clean .Don't know what people want for £50 per night in this area .Only reason I've given 4* is because the room we had (935) the shower would only be really hot or cold  would stay here again",Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Overnight stay,I stayed on Saturday night as part of a National Holiday break. The duty manager came aboard our coach to give us information about our stay. My room (number 328) was massive and spotlessly clean. The furniture was a little dated and worn but overall I was impressed with my room. Meals were okay but the food was more luke warm than hot. I thought the price for the drinks in the bar were very reasonable. For the price I had paid for my break I was pleasently suprised with the hotel and I would happily stay again.,Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Rats,There was a rat in the conservatory bar and another seen in the lounge.  Staff were told and they were not surprised and they just fobbed it off saying that a contractor was dealing with the problem.  They made no effort to find the rats themselves.  I was completely horrified and wanted to leave straight away.  Room very tatty and run down. Couldn't wait to get out of the place.  Must have been a nice hotel when it opened in the 1980s but now as a Britannia hotel it is really shocking.,Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Spa day- left within 10 minutes!!,"I’ve been here before with friends who were staying over night, and the room seemed ok, the hotel a bit dated so I thought it might be ok when I bought a groupon voucher but I didn’t expect the spa area to be so awful!   To say it needs re-decorating is an understatement. Paint is peeling off walls in clumps, there is rust all over the place. The changing rooms were not very nice and downright grotty in places. The jacuzzi was out of service and had apparently never functioned properly (according to some guys who go there for the gym every week). The sauna had limited seating (apparently the other benches were removed some months ago for repair and never replaced) and the floor was stained.

STAY CLEAR,Reception staff were welcoming and polite. I paid a high premium because the O2 arena had the NTA awards. The receptionist offered a room upgrade ( an additional price to pay ) which was a room with a window and a view of the river. The river view was almost non existent. The room was clean but in need of decorating. It was the most uncomfortable nights sleep ( not a lot ) that I can remember. The bed / mattress was the worst that I have slept on. They must be years old as the mattress and base was fraying and very firm. ( HARD ) and lumpy. If you moved the whole mattress moved. The pillows were also firm and uncomfortable. All the bedding needs renewing. No fun if you are trying to sleep.

The Worst Hotel I have stayed in for years!,Rat in the conservatory bar - tired and stained bathroom - window in bedroom not  closing completely - fire alarms in morning  (caused by drunk I understand) - asked for safety pin at reception - “we don’t have anything like that” was the response after having to explain what a safety pin was ......English not understood! - all in all an appalling experience - Don’t stay here!,Date of stay: January 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

Room with a view/window if you you can see through the dirty windows which probably had not been cleaned since it opened the view of Canary Wharf and partial Thames view is o.k. To be fair the Champagne and fruit were satisfactory and the room was large (upgrade paid) with dated furniture and marked/stained bathroom flooring,worn gold bath taps from the 80's where a dissapointment especially when you paying close to £200.00 a night with DDB you could and should expect more!

Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in,"Booked through Groupon and can honestly say this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Whilst waiting to check in the customer in front of us shouted to everybody don’t stay here you will regret it, not sure what his issue was but I wished we had listed to him. Was told we had been upgraded, room 1140. Entered the room to see a wrought Iron staircase which was hard to get our luggage up. Large room with a Double bed which honestly looked lost. Very strange configuration as a small TV was at the other end of the room with a massive dining table with 4 chairs right next to the bed. 1 bucket chair and a desk was all the other furniture in the room.

Check in was rather slow, room ok, clean. Good for a short stay. Breakfast wasnt as good this time as it was on my previous stay.

Windows was so dirty you hardly see building site outside, should booked without window for half price instead. Rooms very dated, beds falling to bits, mattresses rock hard with flat pillows as a pancakes. Should have 2 stars top on hotel. Have been moved from one room to another but it was no better apart little bit better view. Breakfast was okayish, cheap things.

My room had missing knobs from the bidet, the sink wouldn’t drain and when I pulled out the plug it was full of hair from god knows when.

Our hotel room was spacious and clean with plenty of storage. The TV worked great and we had no issues with our heating system. The shower in our room was absolutely amazing!

For panic situations only,The description of this hotel starts with ‘A modern...’ - that is the biggest lie ever.   This hotel has a major issue with admin making check in take 5-8 times longer than necessary. If you then want to charge a bar bill to your room; add 10 more minutes. If you want to charge your mobile (and do not want to do that?) expect to spend 10 minutes trying to find a place to do so!  This hotel was modern in 1970’ies!!!

"Friendly staff, great location but...","Friendly staff. I liked the antique nature of the furniture but the room (esp. the bathroom) could have been cleaner- if I'd stayed there longer than 2 nights, I may have got some gloves and cleaned the bathroom. I was not comfortable walking around the entire room barefoot and that's not happened to me before. Dirty bathroom floor and it appears limescale remover hasn't been used in a long time. Lifts are really old and people had to ask each other which floor we were on as the communication was broken (or just non-existent) in one of the lifts.

The rooms are not the biggest (we had a standard double), but for £85 a night it’s good value for the location.

I understand it is at the lower priced end of the market but I expect some level of standards.   The layout is quite confusing due to the hotel dividing itself into even and odd numbered rooms with no indication from reception where the odd numbered rooms are. After exploring for a while my girlfriend and I eventually found it.   As we walked to our room, to our horror, we discovered a salad lying on the floor in the hallway. How long it had been there, I don’t know. Why it hadn’t been cleaned up, I don’t know.

Bed was horrible and hard, shower leaked all over the floor and hard to adjust. No body wash/shampoo in dispenser and over all room smelt funny and could not control heating properly.

Tired rooms and public areas.,The hotel is ideally situated on Canary Wharf close to the tube and DLR for easy access into the city. Bedrooms are in need of some renovation as the furniture is past its sell by date and the beds are cheap quality. Two single beds joined together are not ideal as the quilt isn’t big enough at all. Turn over and it’s gone! Our mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable. We dined in for breakfast and evening dinner on the first day but we didn’t repeat it. Breakfast was £13.50 a buffet and evening dinner £12.50 but the food was lukewarm and of poor quality.

Utterly Disappointing,"This hotel was booked through Groupon. The deal included buffet dinner and use of a pool.   Check in was relatively quick and the room spacious -yes. But this is where the good news ended.  The ""view"" was of another hotel being built. So there was no view ""overlooking the city skyline"". And on Monday morning the curtains had to be kept closed as there were workmen who could see right in the room!

Very enjoyable stay,"We stayed here for two nights on a Groupon deal, and the staff couldn’t have been better. Reception staff were incredibly helpful, and we enjoyed drinks and meals in the hotel.

There is a decent amount of choice, and what I had was delicious. The staff are all very polite & friendly.

A very happy stay.,"For the location this hotel is really good value for money, it's really close to Canary Wharf Underground station. We stayed in a suite which was a good size and the views of Canary wharf were really dramatic. The bed was ok and the room was kept clean and tidy. We were on a dinner, bed and breakfast deal and we were happy with the quality of the food. We paid £7 per day for WiFi in the room which I thought was fair given the good deal we had on the room and food. However, if a family with kids is staying and everybody needs WiFi then be aware that the charge is £7 per device per day when comparing costs. The hotel across the street was double the cost and whilst it's more modern I couldn't justify paying twice as much for the same thing, we prefer to have more spending Money",Date of stay: January 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Cheap but not cheerful,We arrived and after being told over the phone that we didn’t need to pay for parking until check out was very annoyed to find we needed to pay for this there and then. Also as we were going to our room we saw one of the cleaners sat on the floor on their phone and they didn’t even have any manners to say hello. As we came to our floor directly outside the lift we saw a dirty food tray on the floor which hadn’t been moved and directly outside our room we had booked there was a dirty glass.   The bedding itself was dirty. There was black marks on the duvet cover (there version of getting rid of it is by turning the duvet round for day two) and the duvet barely covers the full bed I had to sleep nearly on my boyfriend’s side of the bed to ensure I had a decent amount of duvet.,Date of stay: January 2020,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

Dated or Cute,"I found the room in very decent condition. Sure the hotel has not been open yesterday and bring it up to date might cost some money but I cannot rate it badly for not been in line with the next door tower. It is very clean, functional, spacious and the location for me that I need easy access to Canary Wharf is ridicolously near. I can believe that some had a bad experience and I did myself in other hotels, but I ve been treated or should I say mistreated in 5 stars hotels for which I pay more than 5 times more per night by unprofessional rude staff.

Disgusting smoking rooms with no opening windows!!!,"Apon arrival our initial thought was that the hotel looks quiet nice. We didn't expect the world as it was a cheap last minute booking due to our air B&B being cancelled.  Reception staff where not overly inviting or friendly.  When asked if we would like smoking or non smoking rooms I was immediately confused as I did not know this was still legal within a hotel.   So... Due to friends being smokers we chose to have smoking room also so that we would be on the same floor.   Level 12!! No direction to room given until we asked!!

Rusty bars when our supposed clean towels were hung. This is the first and last time I will be coming here that’s for sure. I’ve never stayed at a hotel and had to buy other blankets to stay warm because the rooms were that cold. Air con not even working to have even put a little heat into the rooms.

I wouldn't have stayed here with my husband, as the beds and duvets weren't very big and also I had to use one of the duvets to put on top of the terrible mattress to cushion it as it was really worn and uncomfortable with springs you could feel.

Beds comfy, spacious room (family room) bathrooms have bath and shower, flatscreen tv, tea and coffee facilities, hairdryer, iron/ iron board.

unpleasant staff members with no hospitality skills,"My stay here was very unpleasant and horrible. I arrived at the hotel around 4.30 and saw an extensively long queue of other guests waiting to be checked in. For a 4 star hotel, you would expect staff members to be able to handle this kind of situation very efficiently. However I could see that staff members at the reception were very slow which probably explains the long queue. Indeed I had to wait 30 minutes in that queue (see picture below) and then they took 10 minutes to check me in which is the longest experience  I’ve had in any hotel service. I was very delayed in time as I also had a dinner reservation at 7 and therefore rushed to my room to drop my luggage and get ready.

Lovely hotel and EXCELLENT value for London,"My wife and I love this hotel and stay here whenever we are in London. I stayed here first when on business, and chose the hotel basically because it was the only reasonably-priced hotel within easy travelling distance of central London that wasn't some kind of hostel. In the past, I have had terrible experiences with London hotels; anything less than £120/night in the Westminster/Paddington area tends to be a room about 9 foot by 6, usually located so close to the Tube that you feel like an additional station. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Britannia, but to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.   This is a beautiful hotel.

Needs full overhaul. Don't stay here.,"Stayed here with work- no where else within company approved budget and was a very last minute booking.  It's outdated, the food is awful and the rooms need a full overhaul. They look like Blackpool in the late 1980s. Furniture falling apart. Told no alternatives- very rude and uncompassionate staff. I never looked at the pool but wouldn't fancy swimming in it based on wider experience. Wifi £7 per day. Very little around other than offices.

Spa area had a lot of chipped/broken areas on the walls/ceilings etc and pool seemed cloudy. Breakfast was suitable and new items were bought out quite regularly.",Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Nice Hotel,"We have recently returned from a 2 night stay booked through groupon, as we flew to london city airport we had a short (£20) taxi ride to the hotel & arrived at 8.45 to leave our bags at the hotel (as previously agreed) we spoke to reception & were told a room was available & we could check straight in. The room was slightly dated but suited most of our needs, only complaint was 2 tea bags, 2 coffees & no biscuits on the tea tray! Not really enough for 2.  We found the river taxi (only a 5min walk away) the most convenient way to travel £17ish for a day rider so hopefully on & off as much as u want.  The second day we got into the centre of London & I suddenly thought I hadn't turned my hair straighteners off, a quick call to the hotel & the lovely lady receptionist told me no",Date of stay: July 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"

Oh Dear,"Perhaps one of the worst hotel I have ever stayed in... its a bit like staying a real basic B&B but at a vastly increased cost!!!  Dirty bathroom,  Towels so small a child would have issues drying themselves Twin beds turned into a double I have no issue with, but for goodness sake, make sure it does not then leave a two tier mattress!!!! Walls so thin, I could actually hear my ""neighbour"" padding around their room Finally the staff....

OK hotel needs some TLC,"Stayed at this hotel overnight beginning of July as part of a National Holiday to Harry Potter tour.  Hotel Ok but could definitely do with an upgrade.

Outdated but comfortable,"Stayed at hotel for one night as part of a national holidays package and was reasonably happy. Double room had a very dated, old fashioned design and vanity mirror had huge crack running across bottom left hand side. However the room was immaculately cleaned with fresh bedding and no dust or dirt in sight. Everything worked - TV, hair dryer, phone etc and the air conditioning cooled the room brilliantly and was not noisy. I slept comfortably in a clean environment and I personally feel this is more important than a bit of outdated decor.  Food in restaurant was good (not outstanding but still nice) and staff were very attentive and kind.

Romance at a price,"I got to the hotel by taxi, and realised I had already made my first mistake. The mainland has never liked Guernsey money but I had always managed to get where ever I've been to take it. The taxi refused my cash and I had to pay by card! The front of the hotel is impressive, regal even. I managed to check in by card again (having initially said my Guernsey cash was good they refused to accept it). I'd met my partner and we went to the hotel bar for a glass of wine. Getting a cold or nice glass of wine proved impossible! They didn't serve any wine I'd ever heard of and none of it was cold!

Rude receptionist - Rooms like Hospital: Not a 4/5*,"Personally found it a disgrace for a '4/5*' and would not recommend.  Receptionist could not honour booking arguing against black and white text though I was to be staying with them for 4days and my company being a regular customer.   Didn't provide invoice/receipt at checkout and was simply consistently rude or preoccupied with speaking to her own colleagues rather than serving clients.. Simply astounding.  Breakfast very badly organised meaning queue and potential 20min waiting time simply to take from a buffet.   Room looked like a hospital room. No safe, very cheap/poor quality free toiletries. Toilet seat kept shifting - overall cheap interior design of room and simply put not very clean. No mobile reception on floor 1 so avoid like the plague.

someone is getting fired,"Really the only people who should ever stay here are on business in docklands.  But it's such a dreadful place that it means one thing,   someone is getting fired.  If your business has booked it for you then sack them & if you can't then get the message,  it's you for the chop,  your company has no respect for you.     This place was built in the early days of docklands & it was awful the first time I ever stayed there.   It hasn't been refurbished since,  utterly dreadful, tired & tatty.  Bed is uncomfortable,  bathroom worn & only just clean.  It's also noisy,  the DLR runs next to it so you'll be kept awake by rumbling until late and it starts again early.

Super Old Decoration,"The decoration of the hotel was like those you watched in the movie from the 70's, I am pretty sure the decoration has stayed the same since its opening.  There are lots of coach outside the hotel so I believe its major guests are from the tour.  The breakfast is terrible, very crowded and not much food variety; the room is as old as the lobby; the service is simply not exist - neither from the front desk nor the bell boy.

Average,"The lobby smells funny (quite like a swimming pool) and the Italian restaurant inside looks pretty greasy, whereas the food is pretty nice. The Parma pizza has sweetened onion in it which made some of my co-visitors feel disgusted. The free wifi is NOT available everywhere and the elevator works slow. Notwithstanding, the view outside the window is great and the location of the hotel is very nice also.

I asked the staff member where was the nearest cash point, they told that the closest was 200 meters next to the Hotel so I went to this one under the rain, when actually no one told me that there was an available cashpoint literally within the lobby..  The room was totally cold when we came in, and no heater was available in the room.

The hotel is old and our room smelled stale and dusty. There is this smell throughout the hotel. It is VERY noisy and the manager has no concern for what a guest thinks. His name is Rastislav (one of the restaurant workers gave me his name) and he is from an Eastern European country which seems to know nothing about customer service.

Good budget stay in Canary Wharf,"Very convenient to Canary Wharf, just a 10 minute walk. A couple of on-site restaurants available, though we didn't use them. The hotel appears used to tour groups so quite set up for large numbers of people. The room was their cheapest option (£75), a small double with no window. They do advertise this, and therefore we got what we paid for, but it is strange being totally cut off from natural light. The amenities in the room were fine, iron, fan, modern bathroom, tea and coffee. All clean and tidy. It could have got hot and stuffy, but we arrived before dinner, turned the fan on and left for dinner, and it was ok by the time we got back. Would stay again, but only for a couple of nights unless I had a window.",Date of stay: July 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

"Good Location, Everythinjg Else is Average or Below","We stayed in Brittania many times mostly because of it's location. It's a big hotel - 12 floors, reasonably clean, way too hot most of the time with the noisy DLR and building site below, so quite difficult to get a good night sleep. We kept coming back but I am not sure we will. It's gone even more downhill with reception staff not really speaking English or just not willing to make an effort. Windowless rooms are way too tiny and claustrophobic with a weird noise coming from the direction of the ceiling. To be fair we were offered a complimentary upgrade once or twice but most of the time we had to pay extra to get a decent room and in that case there are nicer hotels for the same money.",Date of stay: July 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Hotel in Need of Refurbishment & Parking NOT free,"We were optimistic upon arriving at the hotel, the location for all it was out of town, was well connected with both the Jubilee line and overground about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Our first disappointment upon check-in was to find out that the Parking under the hotel is NOT free for guests, you don't even get a reduced rate and it's not cheap.  We decided to park elsewhere so instead of leaving the car in the porte-cochère whilst we checked-in we parked it a vacant parking space; we were there for 29 minutes.

I kid you not the 'concierge ' was 2 meters away on the desk next door!! Well we might as well have had no directions at all because out of hotel and down was not particularly very helpful... we found the pier and had a great afternoon.

No time for cooked breakfast again!!,Stayed at this hotel 4 years ago and my review is pretty similar so disappointed they have not sorted the breakfast out. The hotel is fine and in a good position but the queuing for breakfast is apalling. There were approximately 60 people queuing for the breakfast at 8am. I remembered from last time that you could get toast and cereal by going to the front of the queue as the big queue was for the cooked food. There are no signs or anyone to tell you this so everyone coming to breakfast just joins the one queue. Again never had time to have a cooked breakfast as taking too long and had a coach to catch.

Our room was a big double room (with no window, but we didn't mind) and had a spacious shower room.  Although the walls are quite thin, we had no disturbance overnight, the only thing being the tinkling of a piano at 8 in the morning as we were on the 1st floor, which I found lovely to wake up to. We did not use the pool facilities but for only 4 pounds per person extra, I believe that this would definitely be worthwhile if there for a couple of nights or with a family.

Surprisingly good budget stay in London,"The hotel is just a short walk away from Canary Wharf shops and offices, very easy to get to. We booked an inside room (my wife came with me for some shopping while I went to work), which was incredibly cheap, so I wasn't expecting much. We were upgraded to an outside room at check-in which was great. The decor is VERY dated with dark colored wood panelling and soft furnishings, but the room itself was absolutely fine, nice and spacious, clean and a decent bathroom. The only potential downside for others is that the rooms on the right side of the hotel (east), which is where we were, face a growing building site, which will probably get very noisy as it  grows upwards.

Terrible,"The only good thing I can say about it is the location, but you could say that about a lot of hotels in London.  I stayed there for work meaning I wasn't paying, and I wouldn't stay there again even if it was free.  The staff were rude and impersonal, especially at breakfast. They ask for your check in card rather than your room number.... So that they can make a note of your room number. If you don't have the card you're made to feel really bad. The guy sighed and eye rolled!  Breakfast - they have signs to say when it's most busy, but it doesn't matter what time you go, the room is too small to accommodate the number of guests. They don't show you to a table meaning it's a free for all.

THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER !!!!!,"If you don't want to read the whole review just read this - do not stay here.

I have never been so appalled in my life.  So things that all guests will experience are the long confusing walk from the tube. The hotel was probably lovely 20 years ago but now it is tired, dirty, old fashioned and uncomfortable.

Where to start !!!,"Arrived having booked a double room, given a twin room with two single beds. Not a good start. Get to room, to open door, have to move vanity chair in way... ok! Decided to empty my bag of shirts for the week, only to find I need to move the bed to access the wardrobe. Thought hey ho it's only £295 for 3 nights, what more do I want?  Fell out of bed twice on first night, singles aren't what I'm used to after 35 yrs in a double king! Tried the pizza place in house, was served a ""shop bought"" pizza which was burnt in the pizza oven - had to flavour it with copious amounts of pepper. The Malbec was good though - saving grace!  No windows in my room, feels like a cell. Asked to move to move rooms and was told a group of Chinese school children were arriving and no rooms available",Date of stay: July 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Why did I do it again?,"Looking at the cost of hotels in the Canary Wharf area, the Britannia is the cheapest, which is surprising when you see the front and indeed, the reception area. You can further save if you opt for one of their rooms that does not have a window. This is fine if you don't expect to be in your hotel room for very long, and you don't mind waking up in the complete darkness, reaching for your mobile phone or the lamp to shed some light upon your surroundings. I had booked this option, but when the receptionist saw that I wasn't sure I'd made the right choice, she offered me a room with windows but twin beds instead of the double. This was not an issue at all.   What was an issue is that the windows in the Britannia don't open. This memory came flooding back.

A Birthday Experience,"Girlfriend brought a single night here for a birthday weekend in London.  The good: - Location.  - Check-in. - Left my bluetooth speaker here and they kindly sent it back to my home address. - Reasonable breakfast.   The bad: - Generally dated decor throughout hotel. Similar style to my nans living room which hasn't been decorated since 1978. - Free bottle of wine tasted like fear itself. - Caught trench foot from the spa.  The ugly:  - cleaner came in whilst we were mid-bang in the morning, despite putting the do not disturb sign on the door and shouting loudly 'don't come in'.

Absolute dump. 4 stars? How?!,"Thankfully only had to stay one night.  But that's  all i could have suffered anyway. It is run down, badly maintained,  (if at all ) smelly, uncomfortable and outdated. My room,  without a window was difficult to find. Seemed to walk miles then the room numbers just jumped. Eventually  I found it by accident down an unsigned corridor.  The room had chipped and old fashioned furniture. With added interior design touch of a manky old ironing board propped up. The bathroom was clean but so old and in need of repair it felt grubby. The tv randomly switched itself off or changed channel. The extractor never switched off at all! The stairs had loose and worn carpets just waiting to trip you and hurl you down the steps. Breakfast? Absolute joke.

Alright but nothing more,"The room was very basic but we didn't pay much so that was expected.  Not a bad hotel, not great either... I wouldn't stay there again.

Back to the 19th century in the middle of Canary Wharf,"I read it was the first hotel in Canary Wharf ; I am afraid they have not put any penny in the re looking since... We are talking a 4 star Hotel here... First contact, the reception, not very welcome staff actually...anyway, let's go to my room and use the lift ; 2 lifts, 1 almost always busy by the staff, means queuing most of the time. When I entered into my room, the carpet came with my suitcase !!! old, dirty...well... Then I went to the restaurant for a Pizza, I have had the same welcome that the reception gave me ; and the pizza looked like it was from a cheap Pizzeria .

Better than expected,"I booked this hotel for my husbands 30th birthday stay in London. After looking up the reviews and seeing that the outside looked a bit run down, I wasn't expecting a lot. Our deal included room, breakfast, leisure access and a bottle of wine.  I was shocked to hear the Wifi is £7 per device per day but we had this included also thankfully. There was only one lift working and we were placed on the 11th floor so this caused a few delays in getting up and down. The room was fine, suited our needs perfectly.  My husband was very impressed with the whirlpool bath. We had leisure access but the receptionist wanted us to pay £1 each for a towel, there are definitely some very silly 'extra charges' at this hotel.

Better than expected!,"Booked this hotel through Groupon, then read the reviews.

However to our surprise we were allocated a suite with a huge balcony and a view of the shard! The deal came with a bottle of wine, so chose to enjoy this on balcony. No outdoor chairs but took dining chairs out to sit on. The room and bathroom had a faded sense of glamour complete with round whirlpool bath, gold taps and bidet!

Comfortable,Stayed here as was having a break in London. Ok the hotel is looking a bit tired in places and could do with a touch up but staff are friendly and helpful. My room wasn't comfortable and clean. The air conditioning worked like a dream considering how warm it was. I haven't sampled the restaurant but seemed to be busy.

"Dirty, smelly and dank","What a shame, this beauty of an old hotel could be magnificent! Instead it's been run in to the ground with zero care for cleanliness or customer service. I've been  here 1 night so far (if I had a choice I would have left after check in!) and the staff couldn't care less... the rooms are filthy and the whole place smells of cigarettes and mildew...

Disappointing,"I was looking for a convenient place to stay overnight on a Saturday,  we had plans for a busy Saturday and an early morning engagement in Dulwich. We drove from Norfolk and had no trouble finding the hotel and parking.  Got back in the evening and checked in for the night. Since it was just for the night I didn't mind a room without windows.   First thing I noticed was the signs of decay, evidence of past grandeur that has been left to deteriorate.  Next odd thing was the bizarre layout, as one climbs the stares to the first floor there is a sign on the landing  with an arrow directing towards the right (rooms 120 to 170), we were allocated 157, but we could not find a single odd numbered room in this passage.

Disgraceful,"We had a leak in the bathroom. The manager was rude and told me his priority was to dry the floor fist before giving us another room. All my clothes were wet and I was told if I check out and catch a later flight then they will dry clean my clothes. Because I wasn’t going to catch a later flight because it’s not possible I was then given a plastic bag. Got given a new room no help to the new room with luggage or even shown where new room is. Was given a down grad room with no air con, window or ventilation and smelt like paint in the room. I would not eat from there I ordered room service and it was burnt. I am complaining and demanding my money back because that is not a four star hotel rude not helpful staff and priority is not the customer.

Do not recommend,"We didn’t get off to a great start first they put us in a double room respite paying extra to book a twin room.

When we came back later again she put us in the double, we explained the lady earlier said she was sorting it but clearly no record was made. We were then moved to a twin. Great. Well until we got in and found it was a smokers room. Absolutely disgusting really smells and is unpleasant. Earlier we were asked for smoking or non smoking and specifically asked for non smoking.

Excellent value for money,"Brought on a groupon offer which included breakfast and wine and access to the spa. After reading the reviews I wasn’t expecting much however when we got there we were pleasantly suprised, I’m 8months pregnant and they were extremely helpful, I asked for a room with air con due to the heat and they gave us a room with a balcony just in case the air con wasn’t cool enough! Views were gorgeous and yes there is a lot of contruction going on around but still fairly quiet for a London hotel. Staff were very knowledgeable about the area and very friendly. Good location, about a 10min walk from Canary Wharf  underground station, would only be about 5 but there’s a fair bit of building going on in the area therefore we had to walk round.

Four stars? - More likely One Star!,"We stayed 4 nights at this hotel middle of July 2018. I have read people's comments about hotel from Tripadvisor and they were pretty bad. Still we desided stay there. And tell me - trust what people write here. The hotel was everything and some. Room: Upon arriving they told us that we have booked a room without a window. I did not even know that it was possible. To change room we payed 20 Pounds/night more having room with a view. Room was spacious but so OUTDATET (smelly carbet, broken shower tap, toilet door did not closed all the way.... ). Luckily we had room were aircon worked.  Hotel Maintenance: There was none.

Yes close to carnary wharf but geared for the budget tour groups. Front desk staff was a struggle to understand.. Concept of hospitality was only apparent at concierge desk.

Great location but needs maintenance,"Stayed two nights, Good things: the location, close to restaurants, a Mall, convenience stores and a underground station (Canary Wharf). Bad things: The air conditioning was not working, I reported it and they said ""open the window"", I tried but it was locked, I reported it again and they said ""use the fan that is in the closet"", I tried to do that but it fell apart when I turned it on. They weren´t surprided when I reported the air conditioning, so they did know it but they gave me that room anyway, and I really felt they didn´t care to much about it.

Hmmm.,"This has got to be the most bizarre hotel I’ve ever stayed in — it’s like it used to be nice, the staff would like it to be nice again, but someone really fudged the maintenance budget and the maintenance just ... isn’t done. The furniture all needs to be replaced; the fixtures all need to be replaced. There was a statue at the entrance to the tenth floor with a missing finger. The floor-indicator light and cover were busted in one of the elevators. They left the bags of dirty laundry in the hallways overnight. Stuff like that.  The beds were pretty hard, but I slept on worse over the course of my trip.

The staff members at the reception and conceigage were very friendly as well.   We had issues with the room smelling terribly bad due to a part of the carpet always being wet. The facilities of the bathroom were not that great either.  The door was jammed and the toilet would not flush.

Horrible horrible,If I could I would give this hotel 0 stars. How is it possible that a 4* hotel to have rooms with no windows or air conditioning? The whole place was a sauna.

Jebus H Christ what a $h1t hole,If I could have given this hotel 0 or of 5 I would have done. This place is to be avoided at absolutely all cost.  £140 for a smoking room and bear in mind I’m asthmatic and have all sorts of allergy’s with a window which opens onto some sort of duct venting something horrible from somewhere. The room ( well it’s a smokers room ) absolutely honks and the decor is beyond reproach - it might have been ok  in the early 70s - certainly doesn’t look like it’s been changed since then. I’ll whack some photos in this review so you can judge for yourself. Seriously this is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in and to have to pay £140 for the privilege is shockingly exorbitant.

Lovely stay.,I booked this hotel through a groupon deal. I upgraded to an executive double but was happy to be upgraded to a suite. Room was clean and tidy. Really spacious with a spiral staircase from the entrance to the bedroom area. We found the staff really helpful and the indian resturant was fantastic.  The view from the balcony was great to the left was the thames to the right the thames and back of o2 but there was a lot of construction opposite but i guess thats canary wharf!!

Not Great,"Very dated, staff almost seemed embarrassed when asked to move to a room with Aircon, as it was the hottest day of the year.  A small box room with no fan or Aircon was not acceptable.   Alternative room was fine, again very dated, dirty carpet, wallpaper struggling to stay on the walls, chipped sink etc.  Only one lift worked so everyone queued for a very very slow lift.

Old and worn. Welcome to the eighties.,"Worn out carpet and woodwork. Bad mattresses. Smells unclean. Noisy airconditioning. No free wifi. No free pool. Not enough electric outlets. Dirty dusty windows. Old and tired hotel. Called reception for soap and shampoo and an arrogant lady called Andrea said she would TRY to get them to us so I went to reception in my shorts to get them myself. To say that this all has an eastern european feel to it, would be insulting eastern Europe. Lifts are so slow that if your room is on the 8th floor you consider jumping out of the window. There is a reason why they don’t open. One lift display is broken so you can’t even see which floor you are on so you get out on the wrong one and have to wait for the next lift.

Overnight stay.,Perfectly fine for an overnight stay.  Had a trip down with National Holidays and stayed overnight in this hotel.  The room was a bit dated but very clean and the bedding was sparkling white and spotless.  Bed was comfy and the shower was good. The food was tasty and of reasonable quality for a hot buffet. One criticism is there are no signs on or above food to say what it is so you have a bit of guesswork before you pick what you want! We noticed the next morning that there was a blackboard stating what food was on but as this wasn't pointed out we hadn't noticed it the evening before. That said Breakfast was very good.

"Pleasant hotel, very close to the centre of Canary Wharf","We stayed here a year ago and got one of their standard double rooms, then we booked an extra night on the day so were given a different room, which was much more modern and had a balcony but was somehow cheaper! If you can, request a room with a balcony, it's lovely to look out of the water, even with the construction work. Unfortunately this time round the hotel was fully booked. During our visit last year was our only experience of the food, ordered one of their pizzas for room service - I'd say stick with ordering in Papa John's who will deliver super quick as Britannia's pizza seemed like a frozen pizza and was the same price.

I actually enjoyed my stay here because it wasn’t trying to be something it isn’t. The wallpaper clashed with the carpet and there were the most bizarre pictures hanging above the bed but in my opinion that only added to the charm of the place.

The entrance and lobby has a faded sense of corporate 90s grandeur that hints at the shabbiness throughout the rest of the hotel.

Lord knows what the standard room is like. Yes, my room was clean and tidy. But there was a staleness about the air and you wouldn't be surprised if the previous occupant had died in it.

It is stuck out in the middle of Canary Wharf, an uncomfortable journey from theatreland and national rail networks, but this didn't matter to me because it had a pool and was reasonable priced...  ...How wrong was I?!! The single selling point - the pool - was a 'pay to use' pool arrangement. One could easily have booked any hotel next to a community pool for less expense and effort.

Also the water takes a bit to get hot in the shower.  Trying to use the lifts during early morning can be a long wait.   Despite those annoyances,  it was a great stay and I would actually stay again.",Date of stay: July 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Wipe your feet on the way out!,"First and last time here!  Booked the executive suite, mistake... nothing executive about this room, yes it’s spacious but that’s it!  Waited far too long to check in, they take full payment upfront (found that strange). Once checked in, advised there was no spare room keys and I should head to my room where someone was waiting to let me in... got to the room and found the door left open and no one around. Very strange.  Room had a spiral staircase to an upstairs large room with a large balcony, tv iron and tea making facilities. Oh and a somewhat tiny double bed. Carpet stained 😳  Bathroom was even more dated than the main room and very dirty with stains on the toilet seat and floor.   Went to the bar (cage) to order drinks and even the staff took the piss out of the hotel 😆",Date of stay: July 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Wished the hotel was as good as it's staff,"Gosh - Not quite sure where to start.  Firstly, the staff were great, helpful and pleasant but they didn't reflect the hotel it's self. The location is good but there is currently building work everywhere around it.  Walked into the first room we were given to be greeted by a very strange smell and a stained carpet, didn't stay long enough to investigate further. We were moved politely and without question to another room.  It was clean and did not smell so we stayed. However it was so shabby and dated, peeling wallpaper, missing pictures from the walls, damp ceiling, damaged furniture..... Windows were filthy and couldn't be opened at all.  The rest of the hotel was desperately unloved and in need of a total refurbishment.   It could be great but some serious money needs to",Date of stay: July 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Worst hotel ever!,"Stayed here last night. Was given a room with no windows and no air con. Asked to be moved and was told there was a price difference. When I loudly exclaimed ‘you want me to pay £20 extra for a room with a window?’ They backed down and moved me to a room with a window that couldn’t be opened. I went back... they said someone would come and open the window. I went back to my room for 30 mins and examined the window... unless they were planning to put a brick through it, it couldn’t b opened. There were no locks or hinges. So I went back again and asked to either be put in a room with a functioning window or be given a full refund.

Birthday weekend,"Booked here on a uk breakaway deal, location very good and easy access to London via the very near tube station, or the DLR we didn’t use this but we did use the tube and was very good access to central London, the hotel itself I didn’t have any issues was a bit worried about it after reading reviews, but lady on check in was lovely we arrived a little early but room was ready, was on 9th floor view wasn’t great, but we didn’t spend much time in there as we were too busy enjoying London, the food was ok just buffet style limited choice but we had a good breakfast on both days, all in all was a pleasant stay I do think the windows could do with a good clean but I’m guessing that can’t be helped due to being located on the Thames and building world going on would stay here again",Date of stay: July 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Bloodstains and Insult,"I had booked months in advance through Booking.com. I reserved a double twin room non-smoking. When I checked in and my sister and I got into the room, it was a handicap room (not initially a problem) but it had a single queen bed and the room reeked of cigarette smoke. Like a sports bar.   It will be good to note to you guys visiting that although there is a television in the room, they only had radio stations available, and wifi costs £7 per day.   We were trying to be forgiving and thought we could make the bed work, but upon further inspection we found sinister looking smears of unknown dried fluid on the wallpapered walls and bloodstains on the chair and tiles of the bathroom floor.

"Clean hotel with location, some staff let it down","Myself and my partner stayed here to celebrate his birthday. The location was perfect however on arrival we were told that because we didn’t have the payment card we couldn’t check in without refunding the original card (payment had cleared and we have proof of this and ID) and paying again. This meant that they had two payments. When myself and my partner looked a little confused the lady who checked us in became passive aggressive and spoke to us like children. She said we had ‘to pay attention’ when booking. This was not said in a jovial manner but rather in a very patronising way.

Disappointed in so many ways,"10 minute walk to the Canary Wharf tube station and in an area that is growing and has lots of new construction. With luggage it’s a rough walk. The hotel has a view of the river but the windows are so filthy that your view is obscured.  The entire hotel needs an update. Main Entrance, carpets, drapes, bathrooms, beds, lobby, elevators, everything. WiFi is not free unless you are in the lobby and the free WiFi is terrible.  Charging a meal to your room from one of the restaurants is problematic unless you have a special card indicating that you have your cc on file with the front desk. If you don’t have this card, well, let me just say, your experience is not pleasant. Talk about poor customer service!  I would not recommend this hotel.

Don’t waste your money!,First and last time we will stay at this hotel! Waited for 25 minutes to check in then check in process took an eternity the receptionist who we dealt with really needs a lesson in customer service. Went to get our evening meal which we had paid for when we booked the hotel but where told by another unhelpful member of staff what they’d stopped serving 5 minutes ago!! Went to our room it was grubby with wallpaper that really needs replacing as it’s damaged and peeling. Furniture that has seen better days. Things didn’t improve at breakfast the orange juice had been diluted with water to the point it was tasteless and so was the cooked breakfast.  Spoilt a very much needed break away.

I checked if we had a balcony at check in & was advised not.  I queried how much extra this would be, and the receptionist provided this complementary.  Off to a good start!  Our room was clean & had enough space so we weren't climbing over each other.  The beds were very comfy, and we had an amazing sleep each night.

Ok as a base,Stayed here for 3 nights. It’s ok as a base to explore the city but that’s it. If you are expecting anything else from this place then you will be disappointed.

The hotel is not full but I am allocated a room on 2nd floor facing a trash ground and the DLR train, that I can hear the train whenever it passes, starting 5am.

When checking in there was a queue of around 5 people and only one trainee on the desk so waited for around 15 minutes to get the room key. She also didn't say what floor or how to get there.  Shower and bath didn't work very well and it leaked all over the bathroom floor.  I would think there are better places to stay in Central London at the same price I paid.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
No sleep.......like sleeping on a hardboard,"The staff are great the hotel reception beautiful and the room was a lovely size, however......the bed was so hard I ended up with a bad back.  The breakfast was ok not brilliant but I had to move tables away from the window due to it being filthy.  I would love to go back when they have updated the beds and given the hotel a bit of TLC.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
"Perfect, pleasantly surprised!","Had to book a room hear last minute, I was worried because some of the reviews on here but was pleasantly surprised when we got there. Staff were very friendly. Room was a bit outdated but it was clean, comfortable and very large. We paid £125 for a family room and there was plenty of space for the 3 of us with a very large window and lovely view. You do have to pay for the wifi but this didn't effect us as there is good 4g signal so we just used our phones. We would definitely stay again!",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Poor service from the staff,"The staff here are very slow and don't seem to understand hospitality. Especially at the concierge booth. They provided us with incorrect information multiple times. There seems to be a partnership with the private cabs who aren't very good. I got the feeling we were being scammed multiple times. The hotel is older and very out of date. Grungy would be a good word. However the rooms are big, bathrooms seem modern and I found the bed comfortable. The bar downstairs and the lounge area are a blast. The bartenders were great and we spend a lot of time down there. Gym was dated but still better than most modern hotels. So overall it's not terrible but the front lobby staff need some real training to run a hotel like the rest.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Slow................... Check in,"So this hotel gets 3 stars on that basis on the rate charged. It's quite worn at the edges but acceptable. I was upgraded to an 'executive' room (thank you hotel) which spacious. Bed was ok rather than great. The room did look worn at the edges.   The issues for me were the slow slow check in. 5 people in front of me equals nearly 20 minute wait. The other issue was the shower. Expect to spend a lot of time trying to get the right temperature and needing to be quick at moving not to get burnt and bean expert at very finely turning the taps. The water can get very hot very quickly.   So in summary, worn at the edges, some irritations, but cheaper than many hotels - which it needs to be.",Date of stay: June 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

"Tired, aging hotel","Near to Canary Wharf, this hotel is old, tired, and desperately in need of refurbishment, the rooms are small, carpets look dirty, lighting very poor.

Too Highly Priced,"A 2 star hotel, with 4 star prices masquerading as a 4 star.  Check in painfully slow.  Rooms look tired.

2 night Groupon deal,"Booked this through groupon for my boyfriends birthday. The Hotel itself is pleasant enough. Nothing fancy, the decor is dated (throwback to the 70's!) however this did not bother us as it was clean, and the rooms were nice other than the windows dont open and the air con is noisy|! Used the gym and pool, again both a little old but clean enough. The breakfast was rank but was part of the deal so cant complain too much!

"4 star hotel claim, 2 star hostel operation.","This was a real disappointment for me.   I had hoped to stay at the hotel for a while the insurance takes care of a flood in my flat.   But I couldn't stay longer than a week, and I only stayed a week because there was a no cancellation policy.   The conclusion I came to about the operation here was someone asked ""what is the absolute minimum we can do to get 4 stars and just about get away with it"" and have run on this premise ever since.   The decor is tired and pretty out of place in Canary Wharf these days, but this would be forgivable if there were some redeeming features.   But there aren't many.   The staff are disinterested and everything feels like it is a huge hassle for them.   The room:  The bed was hard and the pillows uncomfortable.

4 star? You're having a laugh!,"This hotel may have at one point been a 4 star hotel but it's barely even 1 star now.

AGAIN Don't believe the bad reviews!!!,"We stayed here about 5 years ago on 2 separate occasions and did not understand the bad reviews written about this hotel. My partner and I took his mother and sister here for one night whilst taking in a concert last weekend and the reception area looked just as impressive as it did before and the staff were just as accommodating. Yes when we went to our rooms they are looking a little tired now and could do with redecorating but they were lovely and clean and very big. And yes there is a lot of construction work going on around the hotel, hardly their fault and to be honest it did not disturb our sleep.The deal we had included the room, full breakfast, a bottle of wine ( a good wine too) and the use of the health club and was an excellent price.

Convenient and Comfortable,"This hotel is not brand-new but is well maintained and comfortable. It is a little distance from Central London but the convenience of the Tube and the DLR makes access to city centre attractions quick and easy from terminals in Canary Wharf just a few minutes across the pedestrian bridge.  We were given a large, corner room on the 11th floor which was generously sized, well appointed and completely satisfactory. The buffet breakfast has a good variety of hot and cold dishes and caters for a wide range of tastes. The Pizzeria has a modest but adequate menu. Throughout the hotel staff are pleasant and efficient. The pool/gym is a useful additional facility and again is in good condition for an older hotel.  This is an excellent base for a short break in the capital.",Date of stay: June 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Definitly avoid this hotel. A éviter absolument.,"The worst service & quality i've seen. for the price i paid, it is totally unacceptable.  Housekeeping and service are the worst i've seen : 9pm housekeeping forgot to let towels. I ask the desk to send bring towel to my room. Answer is ""you have to ask on morning"" !!!! I was under my shower, wet. I had to call again 2 times (more thant 20min wait) before someone take care of my request.  Old and dirty room. climate control works or not ... Bathroom averaged clean. Does not respect bought packages (corporate package with wifi, but refuse to give me wifi access).  Was here for a business trip.

Don't believe the bad reviews!,"I booked to stay here whilst visiting London with my 9 year old for sightseeing and a musical. After reading all the negative reviews I was very apprehensive about staying and even looked at alternatives in case the hotel wasn't up to standard.   Do not believe the bad reviews on here. The reception area was full of character and lovely, the reception staff were very helpful and we were offered a free upgrade as we had booked a windowless room.   The room itself was a non smoking room on the second floor and was very clean and not old and tired at all. Our corridor was separated by some doors from the lifts, the smoking half of the floor did smell of smoke but as our hallway was separated by a door this didn't affect us and our corridor actually smelt fresh and clean.",Date of stay: June 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

Although construction is going on outside you could look past that down the river and no noise whatsoever.

We had a good view of docks, however there is lots of building work going on. We found the bed rock hard this time and the furniture is very tired looking. The breakfast was plentiful and the staff were helpful. The bar in the hotel stayed open past midnight, however we tried to wander around the docks approx 22:45 and couldn't get a drink anywhere as they were all closing.

Good Value,"London is notoriously expensive to stay in a hotel so when I have to visit London mainly to attend events and awards and I'm having to pay for my own accommodation I'm always looking for value for money and location. Canary Wharf may not be a classic location for London but if you want to find an acceptability priced hotel or reasonable quality the Britannia International Hotel fits the bill. Must have been an impressive building and interior when first built as it still maintains many of those features today albeit a little worn and slightly sad in areas, its still not lost that 'expensive' air.

Grand Hotel amongst all the Modern Blocks,"We were impressed with this hotel especially as we had gone on a cheap offer and often that doesn't go well.  There aren't many car parking spaces so if you need to park  arrive on time.  It is a lovely looking hotel with a large foyer and lounge area with grand chandeliers and comfy sofas.  There are several bars and restaurants so you aren't spoilt for choice of where to eat or drink.  The check in and out was efficient and in between that, the concierge was very helpful.  Our room was spotlessly clean and spacious although as it was a very hot weekend we struggled to cool it down as we couldn't open the windows and the fan wasn't enough - that won't happen often in this country though and we were on the 10th floor so it is understandable.

This type of proactive customer service was highly appreciated, as the city was under heatwave.  Though the room was bit on the scruffy side (tapestry and furniture worn out), it was clean and had all basic amenities, coffee/tea making stuff, hairdryer, iron + board etc. If you want to keep your valuables in a safety box, you need to ask it from reception, as there's no safety boxes in the rooms.

"Great Location, tired rooms","The location is brilliant with good connections into London. The building looks lovely on the outside. The staff were all friendly. Breakfast was good.But the decor and furniture transport you back to the 1970s and it is an interesting reminder of how much hotels have changed. There are big mahogany chests of drawers and dressing tables and busy wall paper which seem to make the rooms smaller, though ours was big and had a great view. The twin beds are the narrowest I've ever encountered, and because people have sat on the edge of them for many many years they have become broken down so that you sleep in fear of being rolled out.

Both the bedroom and bathroom were clean and tidy - well stocked with multiple toiletries, plenty fresh towels and a hot shower.  We didn't stay in the hotel for any evening meals but breakfast was plentyful, even on busy mornings there were very little queues, no waiting around, food was always hot.

The hotel in the docks.,We stayed in this hotel on a visit to the Chelsea flower show with national holidays. At this point I must say that most of the reviews of the hotel were inaccurate  in my opinion and some grossly malicious. We had a room on the eighth floor overlooking the novatel  hotel. Our room was clean and spacious but the furniture was dated which didn't bother us. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable and we had a good night's sleep. The restaurant was on the canal side and we always tried to get a table by the window. The service was good  and all the staff were polite and helpful.

"Tired old building, desperately needs refurb, but great location","On the positive side: The location was great, just across the road from the monorail station which brought us to the city centre within 15 to 20 minutes. Absolutely tremendous. There was a really nice view from my room, we were quite high up so we could see the entire city from our angle. Just across the road and down the street a little, there was a small Tesco supermarket which was great to purchase some late night snacks and fruit juices. The bathroom was quite a good size, there was room to move and shower. The room temperature was good, you just needed a little patience for it to get going after setting the desired temperature. A great aspect of this hotel is the breakfast and dinner areas.

Was OK!,"The hotel served its purpose for us (to an extent) which was basically a place to kip after a couple of very busy days out. Overall it was clean, but not spotless. It's a very dated and tired looking hotel which I'm sure was very swanky during its heyday but now lives in the shadows of newly built modern establishments which are cropping up all around it at quite a rate.  Quite sad as there are some lovely features in the lobby and bar areas. My sister in laws room had an ornate spiral staircase and balcony, whilst our room had a spa bath and dining table which seated 6, ghostly remnants of a grander past.

After a short discussion, our 'upgrade' was free. We heard the news of the upgrade delivered to other guests on check in as well. Also, wifi is a further £7 a day. Just needs to be factored in.

It's true that it is in desperate need of a fairly thorough refurbishment as it is tired, worn, shabby in places and lacking a  degree of continuing TLC and maintenance.

Room is basic but has everything you would expect (tea/coffee facilities, fair size wardrobe, iron etc), the main thing for us was it was clean. Checking in was quick and easy. We made use of the underground parking which was £21 for 24hours.  We didn’t use the pool or hotel bar and restaurant as we literally just put our heads down here for the night.

The room was basic and had stand along furniture that looked like it was out of an MFI store. The kettle was faulty and would switch on and off by itself and the shower was loose and dangerous. The windows were filthy as just nearby they are constructing a new skyscraper. The only bonus was that it was a quiet part of the hotel with little noise.

We had breakfast and dinner and the food was very well cooked and very fresh.

What a waste of money!!,"I will start this by saying I understand London is expensive but you still expect value for money!   This hotel is outdated and is in need of one hell of a makeover! For £120 a night it’s shocking. The bedroom looks like it’s not been decorated since the 60’s, there’s was peeling wallpaper, questionable portraits, damage to the doors, the bath was a disgrace and the ‘double’ bed was in fact 2 single beds with 2 single mattresses on it. The lifts are inadequate for the capacity of the hotel! We were staying on the sixth floor and I walked up the stairs and was at the lift doors before the lift arrived with my husband.

A little hidden gem,So I decided to stay here as I was attending a show at the 02. Very easy to get to on the underground and great place to stay if headed to the 02. Only one stop away. The hotel is dated and could use refurbishment. They are currently renovating to make additional rooms. A bonus was having an complimentary upgrade from a twin room to a double suite. Very spacious and the added luxury of a jacuzzi bath! Check in staff were really friendly as were the night staff when I needed to get some documentation printed. They couldn't do enough. Standard breakfast buffet would have like to have seen a better selection of pastries. Overall a good stay. There is a bar and room service but didn't get a chance to use them.

The hotel could do with being rather cleaner than it was and we understood that building work was ongoing,  however much of the furnishing and interior needed upgrading.

The second bed looked to have mouldy sheets and to there credit they did upgrade me to a room with a window but one that had two single beds one of which at least looked clean enough to sleep in (at least that’s what I’m telling my self).

Week days break,My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in June . As we got off the tube the hotel could be seen when you walked through the train station however it was not clear how to get to it . We visited on a very wet day .

We walked aimlessly around trying to find another route  under traffic bridges to find more paths closed off .

No other rooms available :(  Reception said they'd open some windows (what aren't they open already)? Got to the room - it absolutely stank but what could we do other than open the windows.   Went out for the rest of the afternoon into the early evening. Back to hotel quite for an earlyish night. Bed was ok, clean, average comfort.  Room was tidy but could've been cleaner same for the bathroom. Tired hotel.   Checked out next day. Lift broken :( walked 12 flights with 2 cases - shattering walk down. Check out took forever. Not sure I'd pick",Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
"Great Value for money,,,,,,,","Good location great rooms reasonably  priced  restaurants  I recommend all my clients and friends to stay at this hotel, the staff are friendly, courteous.

London weekend,"This is my second visit here, the location is fantastic set on the docks. Near to O2 so great for concerts, close to Canary Wharf shopping centre and the tube. The rooms are clean and comfortable although in need of an update but as this hotel is inexpensive for the area it is unbeatable in value. The breakfast is one of the best with an extensive choice and the buffet evening meal is great too although it could be a bit hotter. The staff are very helpful and friendly too. Would deffinately revisit time after time.",Date of stay: March 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Canary Wharf,This hotel in the heart of Canery Wharf. Parts of the hotel are in need of a refurbishment but everywhere was clean. Staff were very helpful and polite. A buffet style breakfast including fruits and the usual cooked English breakfast ingredients. Our large King suite included a whirlpool bath which would dwarf the average London hotel ensuite. It's a five minute walk to either the DLR trains or to the river 'clipper' service making a quick journey into central London.,Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Canary Wharf Revisited,"I used to work in Canary Wharf- it has got bigger. The Britannia is slightly dated in need of some tlc. I was fortunate enough to get upgraded to a junior suite room 1110. You take the lift to floor 11 and inside the door is a spiral staircase up to your room which is in fact on floor 12. Very nice room with a small balcony. The curry was excellent in the restaurant, breakfast was nothing special.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Careful with this place,"Was not a fan of the hotel. Service was unfortunately unfriendly, rooms not great - especially the bed uncomfortable and room very cold and cheap IKEA like furniture. Some rooms seem to even have no windows- luckily not mine :)  Breakfast was average. They serve an English breakfast but the eggs were not very tasty and the ham dry (7:30 am - so not too long after opening). Will go somewhere else next time.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
'Cheap' Canary Wharf hotel- does the job,"I only really got to see the reception, lifts and bedroom and my experience of all 3 was perfectly fine.   It's a bit cheaper than the competition and for that part of London was at a reasonable price.  It's a bit of a walk from Canary Wharf tube, fine for me but could be a problem for others.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Disappointing,"Went to this hotel through National Coach Holidays, whilst the driver was fab and really enjoyed his narrative on the trips the hotel was a disappointment ! Room was boiling hot 30 degrees, couldn't open the window, bed was really hard and didn't sleep well at all, the sofa in the foyer and bar area don't appear to have legs and are very low which is a problem for those who have mobility problems, food was mediocre, very small selection, wouldn't recommend this hotel",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Fault Towers on steroids!,"Booked room with a view and was give a room with on window let alone a view, management revised and offer a room with view however room key did not work, trainee manager, then manager travelled up to room with me and surprise, surprise the master key open room, after which the manager accused me of lying! Entered room and TV didn’t work, again received visits from trainee manager and manager, both could not get TV working, combined with the fact that my Mac could not connect to the WiFi. I’ve travel significantly and have never in all my year been treated as badly as I have at this hotel, it’s a complete joke!",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Fine for the price - some let downs,"Hotel is in good location. The room had everything we needed and was nice and clean.  We were disturbed by our hotel landline telephone ringing at 3am, and again by the cleaner (I assume) at 8.30am knocking on the door - when check out time isn't until 11am. There was no real explanation as to why the telephone was ringing when I queried at the desk and we did not expect to have been disturbed by the cleaner at this time.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Glad to be back,"My fifth visit to the International at Canary Wharf, and I've enjoyed every one.

I can recommend it.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
Good for the rice,"Compared to others around the area, this hotel is good value for money. The linen was clean but the generously sized bathtub suffered from caked grime that had browned over time. Spacious room compared to the more pricey places in London. Easy access to Canary Wharf and the station. Front desk staff were welcoming and helpful",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Great hotel,"Seemed a Friendly hotel and got into our room earlier than stated which was a bonus as had a matinee booked. Rooms were fine, clean and spacious.  Breakfast was nice and had plenty of choice. Would stay here again if price was right.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Great location but..,"Booked a double room with no windows.. What do you need windows for! The hotel is very well positioned for Canary Wharf and is easy to get to.. However, the lay out of the rooms is very strange, the hallways are very tired and the room was freezing! I was told that this was due to the natural ventilation of that floor and I was offered an upgrade if I paid for it! I just wanted a room that was warm, not to pay extra for it. Eventually the hotel sent up a heater, which was better than nothing, but you would think that they would sort out such a basic problem. After all a freezing room in March is not a good idea.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Great staff, great location","We were here for just 1 night. The location is great for Canary wharf, everything within a 10 minute walk with access to the river & tube stations. The hotel charge you close on £30 for parking which is excessive considering you are a guest & you have to park in a dark, dingy cramped underground car park in small spaces with the likelihood (it happened) of getting your brand new car pinged!! Staff are the best thing about the hotel, from reception, to bar staff, to restaurant staff, they are all helpful, friendly & cannot do enough for you. The down side: the hotel is tired & dated. The food in the restaurant - whilst breakfast is acceptable pre cooked on hot plates & OK, dinner is not. It was poor. If you are staying here have a drink & go out, you will not miss anything.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Great Value,"Beautiful reception with attentive staff. Lovely welcome and a real 'old world' feel. I know some have said dated but I think it is quite classic - very different to your ultra modern 'bog standard' value range hotels we have become used to. For a 3* hotel it is fantastic; clean, easy to get to and good price. Breakfast buffet was fab; lots of choice and great coffee.    We were attending an event at O2 - this was by far the best price at only £210 for two nights (with breakfast) and just one tube stop away.   20 minutes of free wifi daily.   Negatives- noise. Not sure if it was the close proximity of DLR or air conditioning units but there was a constant drone in the background. That said it is a budget hotel in London not in the countryside so noise should be expected.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Great weekend stay,"Had a fantastic stay at the Britannia, yes there was a bit of noise from the tubes etc but this is to be expected as in London, yes I saw a rat on my visit at the hotel but this is also to be expected with the amount of work going on in the area and right on the waters edge. In all the hotel was clean, staff fine and the room huge. You get out of it what you put in and it was a great stay all in all and the hotel was dated yes but overall clean and tidy.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_50""></span>"
grubby hotel,"The Britannia International Hotel on canary Wharf what a horrible hotel,got there at 15.30 and the staff had me stood waiting while they checked their phones and chatting and then the girl who processed me was a miserable goth looking thing with no smile or any pleasant demeaner,got to the room and the heating was on full blast and reading 37.5 degrees and i put the aircon on very low to cool the room down but it was three hours before i returned and it was still 26 degees....what a grubby shabby room..bathroom was grotty will never stay in a Britannia again and at £125.00 a night it was disgusting....",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
It is what it is.,"Really quite basic, this place is cheaper than the local alternatives. It is good for getting your head down and if that is all you want, then you will be happy with it here. The walk to the local stations are not far at all. If you are in a back room the view is horrid but I'm told from the other side it is spectacular. The key is the price! There is free wifi too which is always a plus.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Location, location, location","Stay here often for work trips to Canary Wharf the location and price is perfect. The hotel is older and a bit run down, but it is clean and quiet and for a work trip that's all I was after. The wifi situation is the let down I feel, 20 mins free and then a charge, for 2017 free wifi is a minimum expectation but as I said, if you're looking for somewhere to put your head down during work trips it does the job.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Mixed bag,"Location excellent for the 02 arena.  Carnary wharf  tube station a good 10 minutes walk away but only one  tube stop to the arena. Reception  Staff were very nice and check in was quick. The bar was open when we got back after the 02 show the bar staff said it closed at 1ocock.  I ordered pizza and chips from one of the restaurants inside the hotel it provides a takaway  service which was handy for a late night snack.  Room we had was on 4th floor to front of building and yes you can hear the air con units outside on lower roof  bit of a drone . The maid knocked on the door 9 .30 Sunday Monday  not great told her come back later , perhaps the do not disturb  sign would have been  in order .

Needs a lot of renovation.,"Very nice location and that's all. Nothing special, nothing good. Very old, neglected and uncared! But nice staff. Italian restaurant inside the hotel looks nice and cozy! Will not stay until refurbishment!!",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Night Away,"We went on a Groupon voucher that was a gift and was ungraded as soon as we checked in, which was great.   Our suite was on the top floor with great views and a very surprising spiral staircase leading up to a very spacious room. (Very nice)  The staff were all very friendly and professional, but don't asked the concierge to order you a cab, the cab driver wanted to charge us three times as much as our black cab.   Unfortunately the hotel is s little tried with dated or overused furniture everywhere. All very clean.   Our breakfast was plentiful, but poor quality all cooked lovely with deep fried sausages and fatty bacon.   We got the train into Canary Wharf and got a little lost trying to find the hotel from the tube. The couple in fount of us the reception also was experienced",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Noisy and dated. Good location otherwise...,"Booked this hotel as it was a good price and ideally located for what my girlfriend and I wanted from it (a base so we can go to the O2 arena and see some sights around London) The room, although large and had a good view on the tenth floor was dated and needed updating, no wifi in rooms available for free (have to pay)  and it had dated decor and no double glazing. The hotel was surrounded by construction works  on both sides and had the DLR rail line opposite which was very noisy and kept us up with passing trains every 5 minutes  Food: We only had breakfast but it was suitable for what we had. Standard buffet style breakfast with fruit, cereals and continental breakfast options, however the croissants were not warmed up and you're not allowed to put it in the toaster (however",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Not as bad as reviews make out,"I was staying here with a coach trip and was really worried when I read reviews, I almost cancelled trip. Was pleasantly surprised when I got there. It wasn't the best hotel but certainly wasn't the worst. Check in was quick lifts quick, on entering room it is a bit dated but nice and clean. Bedding nice and white and crisp, sheets were hanged while we were there ( only stayed 4 nights) towels every day even though we didn't request them. Carpet was clean and it was extremely quiet at night unlike many hotels I've stayed in. We were booked in for evening meal which was hit and miss. Very repetetive and on the warm side but cooked nicely. Plenty of places to eat in round about hotel though so why complain?? Just eat out.",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"OK, but needs renovation","I understand that this was one of the first hotels built during the Docklands redevelopment. At the time it would have looked magnificent - and the foyer area still looks pretty good - but the furniture in the rooms is both tired and dated.  That said, I was staying for one night only and at a bargain rate and I found the room to be both clean and comfortable. The window unfortunately overlooked the next door building site, but the room was declared as ""without window"", so no view was actually better than no window.  In terms of location; it's about an 8 minute walk from Canary Wharf Stations (DLR and Jubilee). I was attending a function near Tower Bridge (South side), so it was a simple two stop trip from Bermondsey - much appreciated when leaving a pub late at night!  I'm only",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Old and dirty,"I will never use this place ever again, the room was tiny, my bed had wheels on it and the sink tap came off? I am lost for words. they had a iron board hanging on the side of the room. When you walk through the corridors, they have room numbers and arrows on a piece's of a4 printed paper's every where.

One night only,"Entrance looks grand but it's definitely dated. Hoped to be able to get a working lunch but nothing available which was disappointing.

Rooms very comfortable but dated, staff very helpful",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Out of date doesn't describe it,"Cheap. But you get what you pay for, an incredibly dated room but right in Canary Wharf.  Bathroom door didn't shut, and I don't mean a small gap, it was fully open and the hinges didn't appear to work. The decor was 1940-50s  Was clean at least  Ok for one night but if it had been longer would have moved",Date of stay: March 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Pleasant stay,The hotel has great location very close to Canary Wharf station. The building is quite outdated so are the rooms but the staff made me forget about it. Breakfast is good and various.

So disappointing..,"Stayed there for 1 night, the hotel is really dated but that would be acceptable if all else was ok. When I got to my room, I went to make a tea and found an usual ant like creature crawling around the tray. My colleague & I decided to try the Indian for dinner, a restaurant in the hotel beside the reception desk, the selection & service was good. We were just finished our starters & mains when a mouse ran across the floor of the restaurant!

My car has a roof box for my wheelchair and won't fit as the max night is for 2 metres. This was resolved with the manager who let me park right outside the front of the hotel on the hotel grounds.

They got it almost perfect...eventually,"My girlfriend and I arrived at the hotel at around 22:00 on the Thursday night, unfortunately her luggage was missing and this made us late. The reception and check-in was available 24-7 which gave us plenty leeway. Once arriving at the hotel which looked magnificent at first sight, very posh, this was short-lived. I payed £247 for 3 nights and were located on the 9th floor. When arriving at the room we inspected only to see two single beds even though i payed for a double room, i stepped into a massive puddle  in the carpet and i wasn't impressed, i marched back down  to reception, when telling the receptionist she couldn't care less. Up we went to the 12th floor where we had a 'smoking room' which made our clothes stink and was unpleasant.

Weekend stay,"I think 20 years ago, this hotel would have been the place to stay, unfortunately it hasn't moved with the times, it's very dated and the staff really could care less. Everyone's attitude is very poor and there is absolutely nobody interested in customer service. The bar here is nice over looking the water but that's the only highlight.   We ate in the Italian restaurant here for lunch, the food was good but again the staff weren't interested.   Breakfast was very mediocre too.

You get what you pay for!,I needed to visit a client in Canary Wharf and was only going to use the room to get my head down.  The reception staff were really pleasant and professional. Got my room card/key and went to my room on the 7th floor got out of the lift and was presented with a tray on the floor with dirty plates! Got into my room and it was very tired looking but adequate (I'm not going to be living here!)  The light fitting was to big for the room so smacked my head several times. There were hairs in the bed😡  The hot and cold caps missing on the bath so trial and error to see which was which.  The shower pressure was excellent.  When leaving the room at 09:00 the next day the the tray with dirty plates was still there.

Bed for the night,"Stayed at the Britannia for one night due to a work event taking place in Canada Water..  I have previously worked in Canary Wharf so did not have high expectations as it’s probably one of the oldest hotels on the isle of dogs.. Locationally it’s a several minute walk from Canary Wharf (over a bridge and though some buildings) so if poss use the DLR and get off at South Quay.  The room was adequate, clean and functional..and not to noisy despite the amount of building work nearby.  My interaction with the staff was limited to check in/check out and they were friendly and professional enough.

BEWARE FELLOW TRAVELERS!!!!,"My sister and I stayed for the first time at the Britannia International hotel, Canary Wharf in February 2018 for a 5 day trip from National Holidays (who we have travelled with for many years without mishap). It was a cheap and cheerful holiday and the hotel was dated but useful as it was in central London and near to theatres and all tourist attractions which we wanted to visit. On the 4th day, we woke up later than usual and hurried down to breakfast leaving our handbags on our beds…something we don’t normally do – we later went shopping and both of us had no paper money in our purses to pay for goods…£400+ stolen from mine & £250+ from my sisters…it had been stolen from our hotel room while we had breakfast. We complained to the hotel manager who did a card audit of our key",Date of stay: March 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Cheap & cheerful,"The hotel itself is dated & a bit tired but we really liked it. It gave it a bit of a quirky feel. There was a really jolly atmosphere in the bar area. The breakfast buffet was more than sufficient. The usual spread within several cereals, porridge, fruits, cheese & ham, toast, hot choices including good quality sausages. We ate in the pizza place which was ok but obviously not homemade (the staff in there were grumpy). The bar prices were as you would expect (a bit expensive). Friday's bar was only open on sat night. The barmaid was not interested in serving us, just her friend's so we went to the hotel bar. There's also an Indian restaurant which we didn't try. The rooms.

cheap and cheerful,"The choice of restaurants in the hotel was the highlight of our stay. Easy enough to travel in and out of central London via Canary Wharf tube station but a bit of a trek with cases. Great view of Canary Wharf from our window on the 11th floor. Had a meal in the Pizzeria and the food was lovely, staff were really friendly.  Having to pay £7 per device per day for wifi in your room wasn't great. Bath was dirty when my daughter went to get a shower. Free wifi in the lobby was not ideal. Swimming pool steps were a little bit unsteady. Had to pay to use the pool which i wasn't aware of when booking. The hotel needs updating.

Disappointed,"We stayed here on a UK Breakaway deal which included a 2 night stay with dinner, breakfast and tickets to see Mama Mia.  The hotel was really cold in the bar and restaurant areas, which was really uncomfortable. The dinner which was included was the buffet - certainly nothing to rave about, food was very basic, the second night we ate out at a restaurant and enjoyed it much more.  The breakfast was ok again nothing to shout about.  We could also use the pool and jacuzzi etc.  It’s a shame the 2 members of staff didn’t acknowledge our arrival as they were so busy chatting! The spa area could do with being re-decorated and the steam room and sauna were out of use.  On a Plus note our room was very nice and spacious and Mama Mia was fantastic.",Date of stay: March 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"

Good just for the price,"We spent there a Saturday night during St. Patrick’s Weekend. We got a good deal via Agoda, however good news finished there. It has been a bit complex to reach the hotel from the Tube due to roadworks. As soon as we got in, we found difficult to understand personnel at the reception, who was trying to sell a room upgrade.

Great location, and a very decadent entrance / lobby leading to a slightly tired interior   Room for us was 11th floor, with great panoramic views!

Poor... buffet with very bland and limited choice of food. Some questionable cleanliness issues dotted around. One choice of meat (Carvery) which was ham, boiled to within an inch of its life... gelatinous and no flavour. Desert, the usual frozen / defrosted cake du’jour   Breakfast ... unpleasant.

Pretty Average,"We have stayed here once before.  I’m not sure it is any fresher decoratively speaking than last time however.  Along with most reviews, it is somewhat dated but for the price it is good value. The location is excellent for the city and the O2 Arena. The Jubilee Line is only a short walk away and there is a large retail outlet underground by the station.  Because of all the new build works around, we were awoken early in the morning.  Since we are here for pleasure rather than business, that was a bit of a pain.   The room was basic.

Decent Hotel for the price,Stayed for the night 28/05/16 and paid £150.00 for the room and breakfast. Compared to other hotels in this area this was considerably cheaper. I have to say that I was very happy with my experience staying at this hotel. We arrived at 10:30 am and was allowed to check in and was even upgraded to a room with a balcony. The room was clean and had everything we needed. The hotel itself was lovely and if id had more time I would have spent time in the pool as it looked a lovely area. We were going to stay here the week before which cost £70 inc breakfast...which I consider very cheap for what you get from this hotel. It was only more for when we went because it was bank holiday. But on a usual weekend I think that the £70.00 for a hotel and breakfast for two is a bargain for this,Date of stay: May 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
"Disgusting Hotel, Shady Business","I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, and the only positive things I can say about this hotel is its decent location and the relatively large size of the rooms (comparative to other hotels in London).  Unfortunately, everything else is negative.  First, do not be tricked by the photos on their website, or other hotel booking sites, because the photos are about 30 years old.  The carpet is falling apart, in rooms as well as in public spaces, and the wall paper is peeling everywhere.  Furniture is old and scuffed.  Rooms smell like old musk and and mold.  It looks like a hotel that once was in its prime 30 years ago and was never refurbished or cared for afterwards.  Everything was sticky and disgusting in the rooms.  Second, housekeeping is shady.  I had 2 instances where I had",Date of stay: May 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Don't stay there on a hot day!,"Stayed at the Britannia International Hotel for one night on a hot May day. I checked in around 3pm and went to the room which was boiling hot! The temperature according to the digital air condition display was 32 Degrees Celsius!! I had to go out straight away, so I set the temperature to 18 Degrees, put the air conditioning fan to 3 (highest) and left. Came back 7 hours later and the room temperature was exactly the same!  Contacted reception who said that air conditioning wasn't working! The window in the room is sealed and can't be opened!  Needless to say I didn't manage to get almost any sleep... probably the worst night in a hotel. Very disappointing.  The hotel is in need of a major refurbishment but the location is very good for Canary Wharf. Only few minutes walk away.",Date of stay: May 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

Just didn't like that it's an extra charge for everything...if you want free wifi you have to hangout in the lobby..the gym is not free either...there are reviews about being robbed and having things stolen my advice is don't travel with fancy stuff or flash any fancy things...nothing happened to our stuff while we we're away we never asked for turn down service so we didn't have an issue. Other then that it wasn't a bad stay your are in business area so restaurants aren't that cheap and you have to to take the train to see the sights but it's only a few stops away so not a bad area.,Date of stay: May 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Good but needs modernising...,"Nice hotel though in need of a lot of modernisation. Disappointed that free WiFi is limited to 20 minutes... In the modern age unlimited free wifi is the standard so Britannia should maybe look at that.

Worst hotel in the UK,"Upon arrival at reception we were informed that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a room with a window rather than one without (room 926).   When we returned in the evening however it was quite the opposite, the room stank of the smell of smoke despite asking for a non-smoking room. What was noticeably worse was the sounds of the nearby train station running until midnight, and starting again in the early hours of the morning. This resulted in my partner and I having very little sleep throughout the night, as the trains sounded like a low flying aircraft passing over every 20 minutes. I would also like to point out we were both wearing earplugs which did virtually nothing to dampen the noise.   I then spoke to reception about this in the morning upon check out.

A truthful Review and Unbiased,"We visited here on Saturday the 20th May and left today we booked two rooms for 2 nights, We booked via Groupon as we were going to a trade show in Dalston. I was dubious to say the least but on arrival we were pleasantly surprised.  The room we were allocated was clean very spacious with 4 poster bed and dining table with 4 chairs and also a jacuzzi bath that worked well. Yes it had a 90's feel but was spotless and on the money, with an amazing view of Central London with the bonus of fireworks by Tower Bridge as a Brucie Bonus.The Only negative we have is the mattress, felt like it was from the 90's felt like i was hanging off the side of a cliff because the sidewall had collapsed, many years ago.

Amazing bedroom and view!,I was booked in by my business and to my surprise I got an amazing view. On entering the 'room' you go up a spiral staircase to a large room with dining table and shared balcony overlooking the Thames and the millennium dome!!  Television was rather a long way away from the bed and the fire alarm went off in the night for a short while.  Breakfast room was very busy - must have been a coach party but they opened up a new section of tables on request. Lots of choice.

Awful and shameful: one of the worse hotel I have ever seen,"This is the worse hotel I have ever seen in London: poorly maintained, not really clean, room was clumsy, bathroom probably dated back 50 years but without any charm, bed was the worst I ever slept in, looked like a camping bed anyway, room was noisy as if the train or underground was going right through it, staff was obnoxious and unhelpful, I cannot find anything positive and I'm not a difficult customer.

Sofas, dining tables, huge bed and a panoramic view across all of one will and a jacuzzi bath!

The hotel itself, like so many othersa, is a bit dated, abit bit worn-around-the-edges, butI guess the cost to refurbish would be very high. Food was good, self-service style.

I have stayed in hotels of all different qualities and was not expecting 5* boutique treatment but was expecting better staff attitude .  We booked the room through the hotel website and paid an extra 25 pounds for breakfast. We arrived at breakfast 25 minutes before it stopped and was told we didn't have breakfast included in our rate . We then spent 20 minutes having to find our booking to prove we did - by this point the breakfast had started drying out and running out and we had to rush it to check out on time.

Good location in Canary Wharf,We stayed here as part of a tour group. It is a very tall building with excellent public areas. Our room was on the third floor - we had a view of the street but some have views over the water.  The restaurant and bar have views over the water which has a variety of water birds to see. The room was of good size. The twin beds gave us good sleep quality. Some of the wooden furniture was well worn but in general a very comfortable room. The buffet dinners and breakfasts were all good with a good choice of good quality items. Location is excellent - the Canary Wharf station has both tube (Jubilee Line) and DLR (Docklands Light Railway) connections. The easiest DLR station is South Quay - a couple of minutes' walk from the hotel - this gives a fast way to Greenwich.

Genuinely surprised that it hasn't been flattened and re-built like many of the properties here. it sticks out like a sore thumb against the glass buildings as a sort of brown, late 80's building.   However, most of us spend our time inside. If you ever wanted to know what time travel feels like, then just walk into the lobby. Britannia hotels will transport you instantly back to 1993.

Alot have commented that it needs a face lift however the prices are cheap and it is one of the first hotels put up in the area over 20 years ago so I think this helps compliment the decor.

Surprising,"Stayed here recently using a Groupon voucher, i was extremely wary after reading some reviews on here but it was surprisingly ok. The whole area is being regenerated so there is a lot of building work all around but the hotel was easy to find and in a handy location for canary wharf and the new Quays. Reception staff on arrival were friendly and helpful, we received a room upgrade which was good, the room was very large and bright and had everything you would expect. The hotel is dated and therefore all elements seem dated compared to the surrounding area but it is well maintained and clean.

"Tired old place, given the broom closet.","Arrived late and tired, receptionist was quite pleasant but was told that Parking was three miles away and a DLR or Taxi ride back (no courtesy 'bus system), they knew of nowhere else to park.   Very odd that as in the very next street I found free overnight parking and (chargeable) Garage Parking within about 30 seconds of moving my vehicle. The state of the lifts (elevators) should have been an early warning, the buttons were hanging out or taped over with gaffer tape, the interior was dirty but I gave it the excuse of it being a very busy hotel.

The manager and staff at this hotel welcomed us with open arms and even helped us solve some problems. He was lovely and really made sure we were comfortable. The rooms were traditionally decorated, but we enjoyed it. Really felt like we were at  someones home (which was nice because of the flight delays, we couldnt go home for another 48 hours).

Very noisy room and poor customer service,"Overall a poor experience for the money, admittedly we did book a room with no windows however we did not book the wind tunnel experience. The air handling in room 149 was blowing so hard and noisy, with no way of turning it off, it made it next to impossible to talk to each other let alone sleep. Finally gave up after trying to insert various parts of the room into our ears and rang reception at 1 in the morning to ask if they had ear plugs available in reception to be told no and without asking also be told I could not change room as the hotel was full. Clearly this is known issue with the room/part of the hotel and also there was  no way the hotel was full.

The bathroom was surprisingly big, compared to the size of the room  The room is quite small, and without a window. Frankly with the whole day spent in meetings, that feature was not missed.

Staff are nice enough, good selection of bars and restaurants in the place but food average - not great but not bad either.  I choose this place as London was 97% booked - the other options were very limited. Location around hotel is safe with restaurants and good transport links on the DLR.

If this hotel had a make-over, id expect to pay at least triple the price.  Its definitely worth a trip to the bar to look at the ""Cocktail"" menu (memories of the Tom Cruise film!!!).

Abysmal Organisation,"We booked to stay for one night on the 27th May and we were looking forward to our London break which included the London Eye and a River Cruise. Check-in was pleasant and we were able to have our room from 1pm (An hour earlier than advertised)  Just after 2 O'clock in the morning the Fire alarm sounded and there was a mass exodus from the Hotel. Thank goodness it was a nice night as we were stuck outside on the pavement for an hour. No-one from the Hotel, at any point, came over to us to tell us where to stand as there was no seating. We were completely left in the dark as to what was going on as it seemed like the staff were staying in comfort, inside the Hotel.

Definitely NOT Modern,The hotel is definitely not modern & in need of some TLC. The carpets on the stairs are extremely worn; the taps in the bathroom were old/leaky.  I presume they’re trying to go for an old english/traditional theme but I feel it could still benefit from refurbishment.

Disorganised Chaos - Thank Goodness it was a false alarm,"We booked two rooms with breakfast. We have stayed here before and returned due to the location being good for our event. Last night unfortunately the fire alarm in the hotel went off just after 2am. We managed to return to the hotel just before 4am. During the 2 hours on the street outside I saw no member of staff trying to organise the ensuing chaos. When we went back in the hotel, the alarm continued to sound, the lifts were switched off. As we were on the 11th floor, we decided to wait for the lifts, it was a bun fight! Hundreds and hundreds of tired and cold guests, some with babes in arms trying desperately to use the elevators.

My stay was disrupted by the alarm sounding in the early hours of the morning at  around 2am & having to stand outside & wait for the alarm to be turned off and have permission to reenter the hotel after 2 hours.   The 12th floor is a smoking floor that absolutely stinks. No effort to mask the smell is made.

The bed was a little uncomfortable for me but maybe not for other people. We had all that we required in the room for our very short stay.

Better than I feared...,"... reading other reviews.  This is the oldest active hotel in Canary Wharf and once in, it shows. The style is very much mid XX century four star, with abundance of fake stuccos, carpets and velvet. Some of the carpets in common areas are very worn and not that clean. However the looks are generally good and my 9th floor room was above my expectations, relatively large, good aspect (very much my memories of 1970’s upper class hotels), clean although the seat of one armchair was completely ripped. Bed a little stiff.  Breakfast buffet abundant, but quality so and so.  All in all, perfectly acceptable and you need to recognize that price is about half of all the surrounding modern chain three-four stars, hence my rating based on relative value.",Date of stay: May 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

I thought it couldn’t be that bad but oh it is,"Frankly we were shocked. When you first walk in the carpet odor is very pronounced and unpleasant, there was water damage in the bathroom with peeling paint, holes in the walls, all of the furniture was chipped, the windows were so dirty you could barely see out if them and did I mention the smell. There is supposedly a business center... it’s a single computer in the lobby with no printer and the wifi is shotty at best.   It was not only our room because we were shown another room as well when they tried to convince us to stay. This other room was in the same dilapidated state, ripped carpet, holes in walls and again the odor. Apparently this is the norm for The Britannia International Hotel London.

"International hotel, London","4 star hotel? This hotel is dated and run down. The lady which greeted me, was very sarcastic. Kept repeating, pay attention next time. As she asked for photo id. Which I didn't have. She kept saying I needed to pay attention, when I booked the deal through a travel agents. At no point, did they tell me. I needed to show photo id.  Finally after 15 mins of her repeating herself 🤨  I arrived into my room to find the carpet hadn't been hovered.  The toilet didn't flush well, the sink had stains on it. The bath mat looked like it had blood stains on it, and the soap holder was mouldy. The windows were really dirty on the outside. It's a shame, as it was a nice view of the river.

Passport or driving licence or I couldn't be checked in....  The hotel is in dire need of some love. It looked as though it was last decorated in the 1980s, although there is building work for an extra 70 rooms... they really need to redirect the investment into modernisation, especially where there are other very modern and more attractively decorated hotels in the immediate vicinity.

The Jubilee line operates as part of the night tube now so there is never a problem getting back here using public transport.  The service here is great with a large check in desk with international check ins. There was a small wait due to the volume of check ins at the same time.

On arrival we were upgraded free of charge to a suite for our 2 night stay. Okay the room was tired but it was clean and huge with a large dining table and chairs, sofa and a queen size bed. The en-suite had a jacuzzi bath and marble tile flooring and the windows in the suite stretched the length of the room with incredible views over dock land and to the city of London.

After being asked twice whether or not I had booked a room in the hotel, twenty minutes later, my friend and I entered a room that appeared clean and comfortable but, in reality, smelt like damp and grot and second-hand furniture flooded the room. I'm glad I didn't stay longer than one night because I honestly felt like I should've said something.   It's not acceptable.

Didn’t help that as soon as I checked in (which was pleasant and easy) that I went to the first floor and saw a mouse dart under someone’s door! Horrified I was and not something I expected. When I found my room it was fine. Expect stains on the floor. No conditioner provided in toiletries as an FYI. Bed wasn’t a double it was 2 singles pushed together. Some constant noise through the night so bring ear plugs and also bring a mask as the fire exit sign in the room is so bright the room isn’t really dark!

Britannia International Hotel.,"We have stayed at this Britannia hotel in Canary Wharf on numerous occasions and have never had any complaints. It was always a level above the  Britannia hotels elsewhere. And we say this with absolute honesty. On a recent visit we were welcomed by friendly reception staff as always. However this time we have booked an  Executive double room at a substantial cost and therefor had certain expectations. The disappointment was unbelievable! The room was quite bigger than the Standard room we have had before, but NOTHING else was different.

We couldn't even open a window. The smell was sickening but I guess that's the price you pay for a smoking room. The toilet clogged easily and didn't flush properly, the shower was only one temperature (blisteringly hot) and for £20 extra we had a breakfast of cheap grisly sausages, watery eggs, cheap bread and stale coffee.

Old and tired,"Hotel is ok for a few nights, but most rooms are old and tired. I booked a standard double room and on arrival I was ""upgraded"" to a suite. This was the same as the last standard room I had, except for an old thread bear sofa in front of the bed. Rooms seem clean, just very old and desperately need updating.

"Old, tatty and like an oven in your room","Well, the title says it all. The hotel was probably once very nice, but now it's seen better days. Check in and out were fine.  The room was rather tatty and needed renovation. Worse of all, the ac is off in the winter - because it's cold outside. Well not inside the room. 28.5 degrees on my thermometer.  I asked for the window to be opened an a chap came up to the room with a spanner - the windows are bolted shut!  With the window open it was much cooler, but incredibly noisy due to construction work and the dock lands light rail that runs next door.   Overheat or don't sleep because of noise - your choice.

Also once you get out of the lift the heat is unbelievable and this is the same for the rooms.  The air conditioning did not work,   There was also a constant whirring noise which continued all night.

So disappointed,"As a family we decided to stay in London overnight on a whim. We walked into the hotel without a reservation, the entrance and lobby are stunning which really raised our expectations.  Firstly we were unable to book a room a reception and we're told the cheapest room was £300+. We had said that we saw rooms on booking.com for £98 a room. So we either had to book online or at a phone on the counter if we wanted to stay.  We telephones and we're given 3 windowless rooms at £95 which was fine with us.   We then took 15 minutes trying to find our room as they are laid out by odd and even wings which we only realised later, also the tacky paper room signs dotted about don't help!

To avoid - 4 stars misleading,"I stayed to this hotel during two nights for a business trip. The hotel has been only chosen because it was close to there where I had my business. I would not return and would not recommend it for sure.  Firstly, the staff is friendly but do not give the impression to be happy doing this job (they bearly smiled).  Then, I was given a room which the window was not closing well, so very cold and noisy. When I called the front desk to explain my problem, the kind concierge came after 20 minutes,tried to fixed the window but couldn't. I was finally moved to another room 50 minutes after my initial call. My new room was facing the metro which is passing near by, so could not sleep due to the noise.....

Was it a ghost?,Very strange experience when I stayed at this hotel on business.  During the night as I tried to get some sleep ready for an early morning wake up my bed was propelled forward several times.  I thought this was odd even supernatural at first and then I realised there was a false wall between myself and the gentleman next door.  Every time he sat on his bed his headboard pushed the wall that was diving us and propelled my bed forward.  Needless to say I would not stay here out of choice again.

Wish I'd stayed here years ago,"Years ago I bet this hotel was superb however nowadays not so much.  Hotel is dated carpets need changing and peeling wallpaper in lobby and rooms needs attention as does the musty smell that drifts into your room from the corridor.  Only 20mins free wifi?   Lastly air con in the winter this will be a great place to stay as the air con doesn't work. Set it to 16 degrees and the room fills with warm air swapped rooms twice each the same infact worse one was 30degrees.  The solution from the reception staff, who are the best part about this hotel, to come up and open a window as only they are permitted to do this.

Worst hotel experience EVER,"I'll start with the good. Good location. The rest is horrible. From the moment I walked in it felt cheep. A lot of ""lipstick on a pig"". Was asked if I wanted a room with a window. Seriously? Said yes and was told it would cost 20 pounds more. So glad I did. The room was 33 degrees Celsius. That's 90 degrees for those in the US. Called front desk. Said nothing they could do and try turning fan off. Did that. Still hot air blowing out. Called back. Guy said ""what do you want me to do about it? It's broke"". then he sent someone up to open the window which requires a key. So now I can hear the train and construction next to the hotel all night and was still incredibly hot.

The reception are was quite nice although staff looked like they would rather be elsewhere!  Room was up a set of spiral steps once entering and was very tired and dated.  Bathroom especially needs a complete refurb.  Only good thing was the balcony outside the sliding doors - fantastic views.

Upon getting to the room, I opened the curtains to see my £20 view suburban London and a construction site - at least that’s what it looked like through the layers of grime and bird “muck” splattered across the windows - absolute joke.

Second room on the 9th floor described as an executive room. Very spacious bedroom, slightly smaller bathroom with regular bath and no bidet, but actually I preferred it.  Some earlier reviews have been very negative and I was wondering what I would find and there were a few negative points: - gold taps were faded (but actually who cares, they still worked) - furniture including the chandelier and the mirror looked a bit dated - some of the décor and finish looked rough on the 11th",Date of stay: November 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Faded glory but still a great stay near the o2,Stayed overnight with a pal after seeing Steely Dan at the o2.  It’s now an old hotel and could do with a renovation. However the price we paid certainly reflected this. Our twin room is as upgraded to a jr exec with a water view which wasn’t too bad at all.  Staff were all very friendly. Italian grub in the restaurant was fine and a bottle of House red was under a tenner in the bar. Breakfast fulsome and fine despite the worst filter coffee in human history.

Shabby and dated with complacent approach to customer service,I stayed here for a Saturday night in November with my daughter as we were attending a weekend event at the Aquatic Olympic centre.

Although not particularly bothered about a window we were furthered offered a twin bed room with a window for no extra charge. We still opted for double with no window.  The room was OK although must admit a little claustrophobic and uncomfortable with heat and no air conditioning and in hindsight wished had chosen twin room.  A bit disappointed re only 20 minutes of free hi fi  The absolute worst part of this stay and what really prompted me to write this review was the absolutely horrendous mattress we slept on.

We liked it!,"Having just read 3 bad reports on this hotel I can only assume that myself and my partner are very easy to please!  we had a lovely room on the top floor.  It was very big and the bathroom was modern.  The 3 things that we complained about (there is a card in the room to fill out regarding maintenance issues) was the plug in the sink didn't work, if you were in the shower and someone else uses the water in the sink you end up scalding yourself and the air conditioning didn't work - the fan was on but we were unable to turn it down at all.  The room was stifling, we couldn't open any of the windows and so our first night's sleep was pretty poor.  The following day the sink plug was rectified.

windowless room - where air goes to die. great poached eggs,"We booked the room without a window as our stay was extended last minute and you don’t really go to London to look out the window. We’ve stayed in windowless rooms before an they’ve been fine. This one, however, is another matter. Previously the rooms have had aircon but this one didn’t. There was no ventilation at all so it was very warm. We were offered a £20 per night upgrade to a room with a window which we rejected. However, after a really warm night (the radiator was at 5 when we arrived) we asked for a change. The thing that did it was that the room across had had smokers in it. The way the hotel ‘cleans’ the air isn’t to open the window in that room, it’s to open the door instead. So the smoky sir just went cross the corridor to the room with no ventilation.

A sorry state of affairs,At the age of 32 I can't remember what the 80s was like. However I feel like having spent 2 nights at this hotel I've got a flavour of what it was like.   The carpets were the same my Nan and Grandad had when they were alive all them years ago. The shower curtain posed a bigger risk than knife crime to us and the chair that only had three working legs wasn't far behind.   The hair dryer was broken and after requesting a new one on two occasions we are still waiting. 2019 is the earliest it's likely to arrive would be my guess.   All in all a very poor experience and the highlight was probably when we left knowing we would never have to go back.,Date of stay: November 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Absolutely adequate,"The location and price of this hotel was great, however the food was absolutely awful. It was almost inedible.

I wondered at so few people eating. However Canada Square is so near and there are great places to eat and drink there.

Better than expected,"Having booked via Groupon we then read these reviews and regretted what we had done as a result we went with very very low expectations.  Happily we were very pleased with the hotel, our room (number 248) was clean and had a relatively new carpet, the heating responded to the controls and we had a window that actually opened so we had access to fresh air, hot water in the shower etc.  The room was quite small (not really a problem) but the furniture was too big for the room which did make it feel a bit cramped.

You can tell the lobby was really nice in its day but now looks dated. It took me about 20 minutes to check in, there were 4 staff behind the check in desk but only 2 actually checking people in.  I was upgraded to a room with a window(!) which I guess was nice of them. The room itself was very dated, my double bed was 2 single mattresses pushed together and I didn’t dare take my socks off because I was a bit scared of the cleanliness of the carpet. It was probably clean but just REALLY old.  Having said that the bathroom was clean, the shower hot and I slept quite well.

3 night stay to attend a convention,"Started badly with the biggest line to check in I've seen since Disney Land! I was really hoping there was an attraction at the end. Everyone in the line was complaining. Once we finally got a room we started to make our way to our home for the next 3 nights. It smells in the corridor of urine. Dark and dingy.  Lead in rooms have no windows. Kind of like a posh prison. Wondered if they serve gruel in the restaurants.  The fire alarm going off 3 times in the night, first blast at 2am (still I’m grateful to be safe so shouldn’t really complain).

A bit dated but a good price,The hotel must have been very good back in the 80s but nothing has been done to it since. I originaly booked a small room but was given an upgrade for a small price. My room would have been very nice 30 years ago with a chandalier and a jet bath but all felt very old and the bed was very lumpy.

Yes you have to check in using the card that you paid for the booking and with photo ID. But you get an email  reminder about this.

The shower has only two temperatures, scalding or freezing, there no way to take a comfortable shower here. It was ridiculous. We ended up supporting each other through freezing cold showers and encouraging each other through the hard times. If that wasn’t enough, the bathroom itself was rotten.

Every time a train comes it sounds like thunder and the room even vibrates at times. To add to the agony, I am writing this at 5am and am wide awake due to some bizarre banging coming from the bedroom next door since 4.30am!! Now the couple next door (at 5am) are arguing and I can hear their TV. I reported this to the hotel but it didn’t help. This is without doubt the worst sleep I have ever, ever had at a hotel.

So turned up at the hotel a mouse was seen ( in front of the hilton) obviously road works are happening and nature is trying to relocate. Bar Wass clean, the building itself is great and all oldie worldie I love that. But needs a little TLC walls are damp, stains on walls... Something to expect in an old building.

Room dated, but very clean, as was bathroom, kettle, tea coffee stuff, iron and ironing board and TV all OK. Ideal for working away in week. Didn't use any hotel facilities or restaurants and didn't have breakfast but will use hotel again as cheap and convenient.",Date of stay: October 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Disappointed,"Beautiful hotel, the room was nice,  very good location canary wharf was 10 minutes walk that's the good the bad.  Room bloody cold all the air con did was blow cold air temp showed 11 degrees give up with the fan in the end noisy and cold.  Cover on the bed just covered the bed so did not cover us when under.  Tea and coffee in the room 2 of each ask for more 1 extra.  Had the breakfast on the first morning wow talk about rude took vouchers off told sit over there help yourself.

Extremely dated,Set amongst all the modern buildings of Canary Wharf the Britannia looks and feels as if it has been there for years and no money has been spent on the place since day 1. The rooms are a decent size for London but the furnishings are tired and the bathrooms very dated.

Good break,"The hotel is great value for central London and Canary Wharf. Prices in restaurants and bars are very good also for the location and some great shopping centres nearby.

Good value for location,"The hotel is in a great location a few minutes walk from Canary warf, with easy access to the tube/DLR and the city.  Considering this, the price at £130 is competitive and fair.  Rooms are a little tired but clean, this occassion i stayed in a room with no window.. it was not nice. Make sure you upgrade unless you just want to sleep.  The lobby service is a bit slow and staff moderately helpful. Bar area was noisy with the music turned up too loud.

Hot rooms,Stayed here on a 2 night trip with national holidays. Great value for money but quite a dated hotel. Room was extremely spacious but the air con was poor. Our daughters room was a stifling 29 degrees at night & it's impossible to open the windows. A fan helped a little.  The staff were welcoming & the breakfast was very good.

Hotel was OK,"We stayed at this hotel as a package with National Holidays. Hotel is clean, not many English staff, towels changed everyday bed made daily etc. Rooms extremely hot and no air-conditioning due to time of year. Had to call reception to open window, they also provided a fan with no fuss. Evening meal is buffet service. Choice limited but still managed to have 3 courses. Bar service good and reasonable priced drinks. No entertainment. 5 minuets walk to nearest tube. Very noisy are at moment due to massive road works and new building being built outside and around hotel. Also under flight path to London City Airport. On 15 mins on tube to central London.

It Exceeded Expectations,"I find British hotels to be a bit cramped but this was not the case with Britannia.  I appreciated seeing a hair dryer and an iron that was not tethered to an ironing board.  Those little things matter. There weren't traditional wash cloths in the bathroom (they all looked like hand towels), the bed was a bit small and the mattress could have been softer, but overall it was still a comfortable room.",Date of stay: October 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
It's ok!,"I see some of the reviewers have slated this place! I can't see an issue if I'm honest! First things first, I agree totally that this place is by no means worthy of its 4⭐️ status. A 3⭐️ at very best and yes, it's a hotel that would've once been very grand but is now looking dated! But a lot of people have mentioned how unclean it is. Not from what I've seen! It's clear they are undergoing some pretty serious renovations so maybe I was lucky and got a recently refurbished room. But it was spotless. Everything was immaculately clean from the carpet and curtains to the bathroom. If you get this hotel at the right price, which I did, you can't really complain.

Looking out of our window was partly obscured due to the lack of window cleaning. The staff are very pleasant and pleased to assist in any way they can. The food in the restaurant at breakfast is good but for dinner the choice is very limited and not top quality.

Even though they charge for Wifi there was 4G in our room.

OK but needs work.,"We stayed here for one night at the week end.  Check in staff were very friendly and helpful.  Underground car park couldn't have been nearer but it cost £25 per 24 hours! The bedroom was a decent size with en suite bathroom and very clean.  Our room was at the back of the hotel and consequently had great views over part of Canary Wharf.  The views from the front were much less attractive.  Also it appears that not all bedrooms have windows!!!  If you need an upgrade it will cost you £20 for a window!!!

Rooms are quite old fashioned but with solid mahogany furniture. this was my third visit and my room was huge with a dining area and a Jacuzzi!

Out of date,"Stayed here for 1 night for the 3 time over the last few years but this place certainly is deteriorating. This time we had family room on the 11th floor as we had our 6 year old son with us. To be fair the room was very good, very large with plenty of space. Just a shame that it had a locked conjoined door to a couple that decided for a full hour at midnight to have a MASSIVE domestic!! Just thankful it didn't wake our son up and I don't know how it didn't especially considering the 'colourful' language let alone the volume coming from them! The breakfast seemed no where near as good as previous visits. All the sausages & bacon etc just tasted reheated.

Really good Sunday stay,"Booked for a good price via Last Minute - double room without windows. Arrived to check in slightly before check in time and it was not a problem. Also, asked if it is possible to have a twin room instead and receptionist was kind and gave us one. Were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room as rooms without windows are usually tiny with no space to move around, but this was a nice size room, with a good size bathroom. Good value for money.  Only thing that was missing is an air-conditioner since there are no windows, but not a big problem.

Lots to see locally and easy to jump on the tube into London.   Only issue we had was breakfast, although we knew it was a self-service buffet style it was very unorganised and busy. If you queue for everything you need either your food or drink becomes cold.  Would be better if they at least offered a tea/coffee service to your table.

Location is great, short 10 min walk to Canary Wharf shops and offices. It's cheaper than other hotels in the vicinity.  But beware- you get what you pay for!   Staff can't speak English fully so loads of misunderstandings during check in and check out. Some staff really need to lighten up and not treat customers as annoyances.

Definitely needs a total revamp!,This is a very basic 2star hotel maskareding as a 4 star. Clearly it needs a refurbishment and redocorating. It is dirty and very outdated wall paper is in on its all walls. In addition it is dirty beyond belief. I’m entirely surprised that in this day and age anyone would let the state of the hotel to go that bad.  Our room was on the 7th floor but there seems to be cheap quality double glazing so I could hear each and every bit of noise that happening outside. Hence the disturbed sleep. The housekeeping staff are the rudest I’ve ever seen. As I was dragging my suitcase on the corridors they expected me to give them way.

Excellent value and worth considering,"I have been pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Both times I have had an excellent, well appointed bedroom. There are all the facilities that most guests need and at fair value- £4 to use the gym and £13.50 for breakfast, is highly competitive for this prime location. Yes there are brand new, luxuriously appointed alternative hotels in the area. The question is: are they worth paying two or three times the price for? Absolutely not in my view. Stay here if you are paying, on a budget, want to explore Canary Wharf or have easy access to the Jubilee LIne.

Great value for money in a perfect location.,"Having read a number of poor reviews I had low expectations for this hotel but for the price I decided to risk it.   I was pleasantly surprised! There's nothing wrong with it! Yes, it's a bit dated but personally that just adds character. The twin room was spacious and even though we booked a room with no window we were kindly given a room with one. The room was clean with new carpets, the bathroom was fine... no rust.   The bar area has a lovely view. Can't comment on the food as we are out. The swimming pool was nice but a bit cold. Changing rooms are communal with lockers and showers. Dated but clean. Costs £4 to use as much as you like.

Just bad...,"The hotel’s only redeeming quality is that it is within 10 minutes of Canary Wharf underground station and a 2 minute walk from a supermarket.  Now on to the fun part. The hotel is severely outdated, has minimal plug sockets (our room had 2 - which is no where near enough for the 21st century)  The hotel’s decor is very confused (for lack of a better word) and as you upon entering you’ll be greeted by an old grandma smell - which unfortunately will carry on through the corridors and into your room.  Air conditioning doesn’t work - but this is England and they don’t believe in ventilation so you can’t blame the hotel.  Perfect location.

We had booked a twin room and when we got to it I was appalled at the tired decor and the very hard and narrow twin beds.  I got in touch with reception to complain and was offered another room with ""better mattresses"".  That room was smelling of damp or mildew so was declined.  We had a poor night's sleep on the hard mattresses.  The second day my wife was feeling unwell but was unable to rest as our room was looking over a major building site.  Huge noise and disruption.

Near Canary Wharf but not great for business,"As someone who travels for business, there are a few things that I really do need. One of these is Wi-Fi and the other is an early breakfast. Sadly at this hotel you do not really get either. Breakfast is only available from 7am, which is not great if, like me, you have to be in Central London for an 8am meeting. And Wi-Fi is £7 for 24 hours - for a single device only. Yes, there is free internet in the downstairs lobby area but there are no desks, just sofas, there so working is difficult. This hotel used to have Canary Wharf to itself but now there are many better rivals - including the Novotel across the road, where I enjoyed sitting at a desk in the cafe with unlimited free Wi-Fi.

It looks the hotel has not been renovated in decades and my room was in terrible shape. The wallpaper was peeling and cracked, there were rust stains in the shower, and the two towels in the bathroom had holes and were threadbare. The handle was broken on the bathroom sink. I couldn't stay for more than one night of my planned 6 nights. I had my company travel agent find another hotel the same night I checked in.   At check in you are required to pay for the entire stay, and if you check out early the hotel does not want to provide a refund for any unused days, a very unethical way to do business.

It was cold, and no attempts with the air conditioner could avoid me having to wear extra clothing in bed to keep warm.  The hotel charges for EVERYTHING.

I’ll start with reception where I was charged the princely sum of £20 per night to upgrade from a cupboard with no windows to a room with some natural light.  The room itself was tired, showing significant signs of age, and bizarrely a chandelier at a perfect height to hit your head.

Feels older than old,"This was an overnight stay with work as offices are in Canary Wharf.   It’s extremely tired and dated, carpet from the sixties is everywhere, and the rest of the decor is the same. All the windows need a good wash; if you’re sitting in the bar trying to look out over the water, don’t bother, the windows are too dirty to see properly.   Rooms are a reasonable size but again, decor is poor.  The rock solid double bed was two mattresses shoved together.  The floor may have been softer.  Breakfast was the usual fare, and matched the rest of the hotel. They put so much ice in the fruit juices, it made them terribly watery.  The food choices were minimal for such a large hotel.   The lifts; there are only 4 so you can wait an eternity for one to arrive, and when it does, it’s packed.",Date of stay: October 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

Interesting and good experience for the price,"Visited Canary Wharf, London in mid October. Spent three nights in Britannia Hotel. The hotel is well located, close to metro and DLR. I had read reviews of the hotel before and I was a bit concerned. Soon, it was proven unnecessary. First of all the price is cheap for Canary Wharf area. The hotel lobby is interesting, lets say grandiose, not bad. A bit outdated here and there. Check-in was fast, the staff very polite and helpful. In hotel lobby you may have a drink in a lobby bar. The view is really nice in the lobby to the canal, you may sit on the sofa, take it easy and have a nice beer there. There another larger bar also and at least two restaurants. Don't eat pizza here, I did, its probably frozen or something. The room was nice, I believe it was in the 11th floor, high",Date of stay: October 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
It is what it is,"This is a well situated hotel, particularly for the East End of London or the O2.  It is clean and has a fairly good staff.  It is true that the whole place could do with upgrading and modernising but equally it does not pretend to be anything more than it is.  The room was large, the bedding clean but the furniture rather old and tired as was the decor.  Everything worked but it was all rather ordinary.  The shower worked ok but had a leak, door hinges needed oiling and the carpet was clean but worn.  The bed was on legs rather than a modern divan and the mattress was really not good with springs that kept making noises.  I actually slept not too badly considering all of this.

It was fine!,"We booked this at the last minute, through one of those non-refundable advance deals (well, a ""deal"" in London is still pretty expensive, but whatever). Only later did we see all the negative reviews. That made us pretty nervous, especially since we were staying for four nights, but it turned out OK. I wouldn't intentionally stay here again, but our fifth-floor room met my very low expectations. The dated decor didn't bother me.  Pro: decent location near Canary Wharf Tube/DLR station; pretty close to Greenwich (I walked there via Millwall and the underwater footpath; it was nice!); great shower pressure; our room was of adequate size, I thought.

More like a budget hotel,"Positives:   The bathroom was very clean, shower over bath. Some (but not all) staff I came across were polite friendly and willing to help.  Negatives:  First, no porters. I was told in a cheeky way that they had no porters and that I had to drag my 2 suitcases upstairs myself. Yes there was a lift but once you get upstairs, the building is so old fashioned that there are randoms steps everywhere on the same floor.   The rugs at the hotel all need to be changed! Very old and worn out.   The room was advertised without a window to be fair but I was still quite surprised at the complete lack of ventilation. Got very hot at night even without the heating on.

not impressed,"I stayed at this hotel on Saturday , I must say I was extremely disappointed as the spa facilities were being refurbished which they failed to reveal when I booked, it ruined my stay although my room was upgraded , it put a bad vibe on the break as me and my partner go away often and love to use spa facilities so it really ruined our anniversary .

OK for a Weekend as loong as you don't want to stay in,We went to London for the weekend to meet up with our sons who are at University in the City.

Old hotel but value for money,I stayed at Britannia International when I had business in Canary Wharf and my stay was good. The staff was alright but the hotel is very old.

The hairdryer was fixed with a cable through a draw in a shelf. I had to sit down to dry my hair, cause the cable was so short....  All mirrors had black spots like when the silver coating is dissolving...the furniture was totally broken and old... not like shabby chic... far beyond that.....

Pleasantly surprised!,"Having booked ages ago to attend a gig at The O2, and having since read the numerous negative reviews we were pleasantly surprised with our stay (I did book as soon as Groupon released the offer, and had asked for a nice room with a dock view!). Check-in was straight forward, and our room was big, clean, comfortable and overlooking the dock.  It was only 5 or so minutes walk to the tube, and only 1 stop to The O2. The bar had a good selection at not too stupid prices. As a part of the deal we had a free bottle of wine, which was nothing special but perfectly drinkable. I have marked it only 4 stars because of breakfast - the main food was very good, but the juices were very weak and the coffee from the machines - I’m sure a better alternative could be found!

Pretty dated hotel !,"We stayed in the Britannia hotel at canary warf whilst attending a concert in the O2 . It was booked by our kids as part of a silver wedding present - probably for its convenience for the O2 ! It is very dated - the decor smacks of the 70/80’s really it badly needs a make over given the competition within the canary Warf area. It was clean , the staff were friendly and pleasant , however the food wasn’t great , the room keycards stopped working & needed replaced - bit of a hassle when you are on the 11th floor!

Really shocking!!,"Start with the positives.  Staff were helpful and, by and large, friendly.  Breakfast was pleasant overlooking the water. That is where it ends.  We paid for a standard twin room including a small amount extra for a room with a window.  The room was appallingly small and really quite a shock.  The ‘window’ was so high that we had to stand on a chair to reach it and certainly couldn’t see through it.  There was barely room to move about and the beds were hard with duvets that barely fitted.  We decided to just get on with it as we were only there for one night.  At 2.00am we were lying awake as we were disturbed by peculiar scratching noises in the room.  Lights back on revealed mice running around!!

Everywhere is tired, dated and in need of a good  revamp.  In other hotels, I'm used to greeting housekeeping staff and sharing a mutual 'good morning' etc.  Not here!

Very disappointing. Avoid unless it costs a pittance.,"Great location in Canary Wharf, only a few minutes walk to the plaza, DLR and tube and a lovely water view from the bar. Unfortunately that's as far the pros go.  After managing to find the hidden lift and then our room with very little signage for either we went to the bar. After the barman serving the man next to me and then walking off and ignoring me I had to call him back and ask for a drink which he was visibly annoyed about to the point I had to ask if there was a problem with serving me.

WARNING! International Hotel: The worst internationally,"We have stayed at numerous hotels around the world of all categories and the Britannia International Hotel, Canary Wharf, London was by far our worst experience ever. The staff can only be described as beyond rude and even belligerent, from the aggressive room service boy to the inept, pugnacious duty manager we encountered, who handled our complaints with the managerial skills of an infant child. What else? There was no Internet connection in the room (although falsely so advertised online), the queues at breakfast were around the block although the food was one-star hotel quality, and the lift LED indicators were broken so guests had to guess which floor it was when the doors opened Furthermore, in terms of location, the hotel is situated right next to a new, major urban",Date of stay: October 2018,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"

When I asked to speak with the manager, he told me to wait in the queue or go away. When I asked for my belongings back as I was checking out, he told me to wait and walked away. I followed him and he shouted at me to go away.   You could not write this in a book. The breakfast had watered down orange juice, burnt black pudding and the service was slow.

When I asked about the free wi-fi and password coming with my booking, they said that regretfully there was no free wi-fi. We had an argument about this, but we took the room they offered on the 10th floor. The room proved to be significantly run down, the furniture was damaged with bruises and torn-off patches on the chairs.

A trip back to the 1970's,"After a 30 minute queue to check-in I was upgraded to a suite. My pleasure at this was short-lived. The room was a good size but, like the rest of the hotel, was reminiscent of a trip back in time to the 1970's. The decor, standard of furniture, bathroom fittings and even the pillows and bedding were all pretty dire. If it was a quarter of the price it may be understandable as that would explain the lack of investment in the guest service.  Room service is a bit of an enigma too - which for dinner doesn't start until 9pm and for breakfast the only option appears to be a continental breakfast (or according to reception none is available).

Room was windowless, not mentioned in advert. It was clean. Though a windowless room without aircon is never fresh.  Bathroom fine and a pleasure to have a shower that has full pressure.  Towels threadbare, toilet role slim and thin.  Sleep fine though a bright safety light meant it was never dark.  Breakfast ok but orange juice was more melted ice cubes than orange.

The second night the 3 rooms around us were partying together and again they didn’t seem to care, plus the fire alarm went off again at 4am.

"Rats, no allergen guide and awful staff.","Stayed here for 3 nights in a twin room, the room itself was fine although more plugs would be nice as well as more shampoo as the tube provided was only good for 1 night and 1 person. The main issue we faced was with the food provided, despite the food being included with the cost we chose to eat out and pay. The breakfast was ok, nothing special but the dinner on the night was appalling. As I was staying with 2 friends who had severe but allergies we asked for an allergen guide just to make sure they didn't eat anything harmful, they were told there wasn't actually one. When we questioned what was in one of the dishes we were told it was just 'normal' which isn't very helpful and to top it all off we saw a rat in the dining room.

Step back in time.... a looooong time!,"What is there to say... this hotel is like taking a sad walk back in time to an era that I would never want to revisit.  The hotel is dark and dank with a relentless sense of tiredness all over. From the dreadful ‘lounge’ music that infiltrates the lobby and lift area to the pictures that are hang as they probably have done for over 30 years in cheap old frames, it does little to welcome you.  I apparently had an ‘executive suite’, although I’ve yet to fathom what that really means.

The Britannia International Hotel is somewhere between purgatory and hell.,"For the love of all that is holy, do not stay here. The price is low for a reason.  Upon entering the hotel in the morning, mine and my girlfriend’s initial thoughts were “this is okay, dated but okay”. We were staying at the Britannia for one night only, celebrating our anniversary for which we had a meal booked at 8:15pm in Central London.   The room wasn’t too bad, relatively clean, ok view, double bed, etc... However, it did feel a little bit like going back in time, not in a cute boutiquey way, more like in a they haven’t spent any money on the place in a very long time way. We thought nothing more of it and left for the day... Only there for one night, right?  Fast forward to 7pm, the witching hour.

Carpet worn & tatty & coming away from the wall exposing the underlay, plug sockets were lose. Nets looked they haven’t had a wash since they were put up.

Luckily I print off copies of all bookings and showed them that it was, after much fumbling they manage to sort it out. I was allocated room 76, which is a ten minute walk in spiralled corridors and down stairs into a basement under a basement, level -2.

Trust the Reviews?,"So we booked this place, then read the reviews on Trip Advisor. Why here?  Location, relatively cheap, and half the price of other nearby hotels.The reviews had me a bit worried.......needlessly. Cons - bit 70's dated. Carpet at front door a bit worn. Terracotta Warriors and big pigs and ducks, porcelain I think, festooned everywhere. Lift sometimes gets stuck. However, staff very helpful, room excellent with view, albeit windows need washed, very comfy bed, air con, and housekeeping keep well away in the morning allowing you to lie in.

Very disappointed,Firstly we queued for 30 minutes to check in. Finally get to room which was very small and furniture was very dated and worn out. Dressing table chair was worn away and flaking off couldn’t use as was coming off on to clothes. There was holes in the wall next to bed and bed was very uncomfortable as mattress was hard and lumpy.

First Time,Stayed hear for a 4Night break and thoroughly enjoyed it  The Hotel is near Canary Wharf and handy to get to Central London.

AWFUL DATED AND DISGUSTING AND THAT WAS AN UPGRADE,"finding the hotel was pretty difficult at first as its not actually in the heart of Canary Wharf, and google gps makes out you are in the water, so after wasting time I finally found it, the initial reaction from outside was oooh looks grand until you step inside, its like a bad 70s throwback, so okay i check in, miserable looking young female and a load of works checking in, clearly staying there, never a good sign, the place was dead to be honest and I was talked into upgrading the room for £20 extra to what I had already paid with the guy on reception stating we can upgrade too executive suite I expected grandeur so I agreed, well what a disappointment it was, nothing and I mean nothing like the pics! old matt furniture ripped bed and filthy sheets:( I most definitely would",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
"Awful, just awful - do not stay here","I stayed here for a conference and the hotel was booked for me by a sponsoring company. It was not my choice and indeed my advance reading on TripAdvisor made me feel somewhat apprehensive. Sadly on this occasion, TripAdvisor was correct. However it was even worse than I expected.  The location is fine - just across one of the quays from Canary Wharf. Good public transport links. A lot of building work going on all around though.  The hotel itself is a throwback to the 1980s - and it probably wasn't even great then. It is so outdated, so in need of a refurb. The check-in was slow, the attendant struggled to find my reservation and had to go get his manager to find it.  The room was appallingly disappointing.

Dated and jaded,"I was disappointed with the hotel. The room and decor seemed to be from 1950s. There was a musty smell in the room. No fridge/ minibar.

Dated But Functional,"Stayed here on a work trip to London. I had read some horror stories on this site before my trip, so was really expecting the worst. I arrived at the same time as a large number of other guests, so there was a long queue to check-in. The staff were friendly and doing their best to make the process as efficient as possible. I was told my 'Standard Room' was without a window, so paid £20 to get one! The room itself was very large by London standards, but the decor had seen better days. Despite the appearance, everything worked and the room was clean so I don't really have any major complaints. Great shower in the morning followed by an unspectacular but edible buffet breakfast - I went down at 8.30 and the breakfast room was almost empty. I would probably consider other locations",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
"Do you want a smoking room or a room without a window, sir?","Check in was slow.  Mainly because other customers were going through what I was about to experience.  Clicks and typing and frowns and ""when did you book?"".  Ultimately I was given the unpalatable choice of a smoking (presumably smelly) room or an inside room without a window.  By way of explanation I was told that the hotel has a policy of overbooking to maintain revenue streams.  I went for the windowless room.  Never having slept in a windowless room, I can almost still claim that - it was not a good sleep made all the worse by the dreadful bed - I finally found freedom from the pain of the springs by lying on half of the duvet.

We enjoyed a lovely meal in the Italian restaurant downstairs, not only this but you have an Indian restaurant, a more traditional one and also a couple of bars. The location to the tube station is excellent as well. Our room had a lovely view of the 02 and Canary Wharf and the room was well equipped, ironing board, iron, toiletries etc. The room was very clean and bed comfortable.

I could really continue like this, inspiration is endless,  After I complained about the room i was moved to a better one. Thanks to nice lady from the reception.

Good hotel and location. No wifi!?!?,"I had read all kind of opinions, so I was a little skeptic, but I must say it very much impressed us! A little old fashioned, the corridors and rooms have this wooden elegant charm from another time. I had a big and wide room I immediately compared with a suite. Amazing views of the skyline of London. The cons could be that the smell of tabac of another epoque still remain in some carpets. I fortunately applied in advance for a non smoking room. And the absence of wifi in the rooms!?!?! I find it a paleolitic thing, that sometimes makes me choose or not a hotel. I really need to pay for it? It has to be a joke? No...it wasn't.

It needs totally refurbishing. The room was freezing cold, there was an extra heater available but it was very temperamental and so was of no use.  Wifi is free for I think 15-20 minutes and then you have to pay.  The bed was pretty hard. I requested one double bed and got given a twin room.

Mixed feelings.,The hotel is not in the best location for those wanting to explore London. It is also in the middle of an ongoing building project so access is not the easiest. The public area's are 4 star(ish) but the rest of the hotel is a mix of 3 and even 2 star quality. The food is average but the breakfast is quite poor  for a 4 star hotel.

Not even sure why it has so many stars,"Oh lordy... I have no idea where to begin with this one. Probably with the check in experience. I was booked here through the company I worked for and, having seen on booking that they have rooms without windows, I specifically checked in advanced that the type of room they were getting for me would have them. We received very strong reassuring that, yes, ALL double rooms have windows so there would be no issue. Guess what I heard after they checked my reservation voucher? ""So you booked a room without windows..."" Fortunately, after I nearly had a meltdown, they offered me a choice for a free upgrade to a room with windows.

Not great at all - in very poor condition & dated,"I am going to tell the same story as told by a number of recent reviews. I stayed in this place whilst at a conference in September, at the Excel. Now, the location was convenient. However, that was probably about it.  God, is the place dated. Felt myself suffer a very unpleasant time warp back to the 1980's. Furniture was awful - dark, 'cheesy' carpets, dark woods, chipped furniture. Room tatty & unimpressive.  Food just ok for breakfast. Coffee not great - in fact, rather cheap & nasty.  And yes, the noise was bad. I am an excellent sleeper, but still found it annoying.",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Not worth it!,"In a nutshell avoid it! I travelled there for business but combined it with a couple of days holidays so I brought the family with me. The hotel was one of the three options offered by the travel agency that books all travel for the company I work for. It was very close to the conference I was attending so I selected it. Bad decision. The staff is not happy working there and it shows. Almost all of them are unfriendly. The hotel is in need of a major refurbishment. Everything needs to be replaced. In our room there was carpet everywhere (except the bathroom) and it was stained. Soundproofing is unheard of. We could hear the people next door flushing their toilet or taking a shower. We asked for a baby cot, which the hotel provided, but without a mattress. When we told them they",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Old & Tired / Miserable Staff,"For such a great location it's a shame this hotel is so old and tired.  Shabby rooms, not to mention awkward, if you have a heavy suitcase and you're upgraded to a room with a spiral staircase! Breakfast is like the hotel, old and tired.  And the breakfast room staff were quite possibly the most miserable bunch of people i've ever seen in a customer service role.  Would I book for a personal trip?  No.  Would I stay here again for business purposes?  Sigh.....if I must.",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
one night stay,"Stayed here one night 25/9/16 and was pleasantly surprised after reading some terrible reviews.   The hotel is dated and a little tired but is clean and inexpensive.   The reception staff do need to try and be a little more friendly and helpful please.   Asked for a tourist map but they said they had run out...not true the concierge had some.

All in all cheap and cheerful and worth the money",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
One of those hotels that you only ever visit once,"Starting with the plus - the room itself was actually adequate. Over the top retro-antique style furniture and a brick hard wooden frame bed didn't add to the experience but adequate. Otherwise, lift was antiquated and somewhat precarious which didn't inspire confidence, the bar was reminiscent of an 80's caravan park social club and a Brake Bros inspired menu. However the nadir was the staff. Check in was facilitated by two members of staff who operated with an insouciant indifference to the 15 strong queue which seemed to be the fairly standard SLA that they strove to maintain. After c. 15 mins stand to check-in greeted with no apology or acknowledgement of delay by a preening self-satisfied popinjay who allowed slothfulness to vie for supremacy with disinterest.

Outdated and dirty!,"We came here as a last minute hotel booking. The hotel and its rooms were very outdated and the view from the room was just building work. Check in took ages and when we went to get a glass of wine they used the end of a bottle which had gone fizzy. The breakfast was ok apart from the dirty walls and ceilings so it made you want to leave the restaurant as soon as possible!

Overnight stay during business trip to Canary Wharf.....,"As stated numerous times previously, this hotel has obviously seen better days. No doubt grand and impressive when first opened, it is now well overdue for a refurbishment. Rooms were tired and in some places dirty, carpet was threadbare in places, and the aircon was noisy but produced neither cold nor warm air. Given the location,views, and size, this could be a superb venue for a hotel if given a new lease of live. On the plus side, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was help yourself and good quality, ideal for someone in a hurry on a business trip.",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Set you expectations VERY low,"If you come to this hotel expecting a shabby shell of a hotel way beyond its best days and staffed by people who really don't want to be there then you may have your expectation met or maybe even exceeded. I got this hotel for £60 per night and it has a gym!!  The hotel totally sucks if you expect it to live up to the promises of it's reception area, it's like checking in to the fictional hotel in MGM studios which forms the base of the Tower of Terror without the 1920'S charm. The manager at check in tried to entice me into upgrading from the single room I'd booked to a double for only £40. When I refused I was given a double room anyway as they didn't have any single rooms and they were just trying to squeeze a few extra pounds out of an unsuspecting guest as they'd over",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Shocking,"This hotel was booked by my employer to accommodate me and my work colleague as they do many other places around the country and I have to say the britannia international is by far the worse of them all, its very outdated and dirty. Our room had a carpet that was the best part of a inch short of a full one and covered in some sort of stains. For some reason the carpet that's outside by the drop off point was in better condition. The beds were terrible, once you lay down whatever you do don't roll in any direction because you will fall out of bed and land in a suspicious stain! The mattresses are so thin you would be better taking a inflatable. The skirting boards looked like they were last dusted when it was decorated circa 1970.

Shoddy hotel,"I stayed here for business attending a conference at the Excel .  Hmm where to start ... I reserved a non smoking room and was given a smoking room.  The double glazing is not effective as I felt I was actually part of the building site next door .  The rooms are dark and poorly equipped and badly in need of upgrading . The quality of the linnen was not good . Then the food .The breakfast was bordering on inedible . Poor quality cereals , fruit that was not fresh and soggy . Tid looking eggs , inedible sausage , stale bread . Sauce bottles that would grace a greasy spoon cafe . Jam in a large container which looked horrible .  Just a nasty experience all round .

Should be placed on a motorway side.,"Slow check in, full of package road trip types.  Room was ok but smelt of mould, would have had a great view across London skyline but windows were dirty. No water provided in room or minibar. In this day and age had to pay 7 quid for internet access. Bar in hotel undermanned, coke served from shower pipe, just lacking gas and taste.  Used adjacent rip off Indian restaurant for convenience, was the worse Indian I had had in my life! Iron in room did not work, had to wait 30 mins for replacement, late for work as a result. Check out was easy. Only thing going for this place is location & proximity to canary wharf, having said that, currently, due to building work, even that is compromised for those on foot due to lengthy detours!",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Spacious but No Pool,"My husband and I booked a double room, we thought we were saving money by reserving one without a window.  To our surprise the staff ungraded some of us to spare rooms with windows at no extra cost. Unfortunately the reason why we decided to stay there was because of the pool and hot tub and during that time it was out of service, and had been for some time.  Just a heads up that if you happen to be considering this hotel because of the pool, call ahead. The only complaints we had were having to pay extra for wifi and the long wait at the desk.  All and all, if the pool was available I would definitely consider returning.",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"

The hotel itself is completely dated and not looked after in any way shape or form. When we got to the reception we were second in the queue and it still took an hour to check in there was no urgency, also we had purchased a wowcher coupon for this trip which the receptionist firstly rudely refused saying it was out of date, when if she could have read the next line clearly stated it was also acceptable for the dates we had booked we got passed on to the next person.

Stuck in the Past,"In an up and coming, futuristic area this hotel seems to be stuck in the past with a charge of £7 for wifi per device, uncomfortable beds, dirty, poorly-maintained pool area, awful showers and a horrible breakfast buffet. The double-room we had was decently priced and offered a great view of the O2 Arena, however the hotel seems to be in the middle of a building site, making it hard to get to from Canary Wharf tube station unless you use maps on your phone. The mattress on the bed was rock-solid, I had a bad back the day after. Also after a hot day in London I wanted a nice cold shower - not a boiling hot one or ice cold. I had to settle for a bath.

Terrible place,"This is really really a terrible hotel. Old, noisy (there is an overground tube just close by and the windows are not double), looks dirty, staff is not helpful, you pay even for the european adapter and there is no minibar in the room. Basically, you are paying around £ 180 for a bed in an old noisy room. Breakfast is excluded, you pay around 10 £ and you have a pretty basic meal. I would not recommend this. The only convenience is the closeness to Canary Wharf, which is good if you have meetings and work there.",Date of stay: September 2016,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"
Time for renovation,This hotel has probably been very nice for  many years but now it is really time for renovation. The location is good and near the underground.

Without doubt the worst hotel in London.,"I implore you never to stay at this hotel. From the very start we could tell our stay was going to be marred. Outdated and well in need of a clean.  We were shown to our room after waiting 20 minutes. Again very outdated and insecure as other guests can walk along the balcony and either look in or enter your room if veranda doors aren't locked.   Both nights we heard rats/mice in the vents which we complained about. Manager, after making us wait 40mins accused us of lying and said if there were rats they would only be around the lower floors/kitchen area.  Have never been so glad to leave somewhere in my life.

(this was needed as no opening windows) the windows were screwed shut. room was very clean, we had room 919 on the 9th floor and were one room away from the lifts so could hear the lifts all the time, i slept with earplugs in and was still woken by squeaky lifts. buffet style breakfast and evening meal with good choice on the menu, no drinks provided",Date of stay: September 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
A Hotel in an Alternative Universe,"This is a very eclectic Hotel, the decor is so confused its is actually Funky but then again it is cheap for the location.  Handy for this part of London it is clean and warm but whoever did the interior decoration needs to go back to college as it is not of any time period or style. I personally skip the breakfast as it is mediocre at the best. The bar is again to a canteen in a large office complex but serves beer. Mind you if the place was given a complete makeover it would be far more expensive to stay at.

All in all a OK Hotel.,I recently stayed at this hotel as part of a coach trip after the company I was travelling with cancelled my trip to York at the last moment and this was their alternative.  I will say this about the staff they were very inviting friendly and always happy to help.  The food was excellent plenty of choice.  But there was a few downsides to the hotel.  The rooms were very tired and tatty looking in places for example peeling wallpaper bathroom door lock was attached with one screw & the handle was very difficult to open.  The windows could have done with a good wash and the remote control in my room seem to have quite a few brown stains on it.

My partner used the bath which had a built in jacuzzi system, but on a handful of attempts just spat out single blasts of air that just splashed in face and onto bathroom floor.

Staff didn’t seem to care much at all, I kind of got the impression this tired 80s era hotel won’t be in business much longer - what with all the modern chain hotels available right next door. One good experience was the rogan curry in the Indian restaurant, but unfortunaly the gruesome Margherita pizza I was offered the next night more than made up for that atypical moment of of bliss.

Located right in the middle of Canary Wharf, the hotel is perfectly situated in terms of exploring the area and seeing the sights. Was a shame that the view from our window was partly ruined by the building work going on right outside. We both made full use of the hotel facilities, using the spa & bar during the day. Unfortunately the small size of the gym, coupled with the large number of people there put us off using the equipment. Therefore, the hotel would be improved if the gym was extended.

The bar area swimming pool and sauna were all very nice and I'm sure had I wanted to spend more time in the hotel I could have upgraded the room for a better view etc. The location is perfect we made the most of the local area and easily grabbed a river taxi to central London. I would defiantly stay here again,Date of stay: September 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Without doubt the worst Hotel in a long time!,"Entering this hotel is like going back 20 years, the approach to the hotel is lined with smokers outside the main entrance!   The reception has an abundance of brass and glass, sadly both covered in greasy finger prints!! my experience at reception was functional but very brief, no engagement at all.  The approach to my room wasn't very appealing either with an overall appearance of the lift lobby and corridors looking shabby! Dirty cups left in the corridor!   This was only to get worse on my entry to the room, its pokey and small, dirty peeling wallpaper, dull paintwork and a bed that looks like it wouldn't look out of place on a tip, I cannot believe you can be given a room like this in the 21st century?  No desk but a cluttered dressing table that belongs with the bed! the",Date of stay: September 2017,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_20""></span>"

Worked for me...,"Don't let the negative reviews fool you...for the price, this is worth the value. Consider this - I would have spent £300 more per night at the Canary Wharf Hilton which was a 5 min walk from this property. The reception area and bar was above average - you are in the Canary Wharf part of London so the bar is adjacent to the water - can't get much better than that ambience-wise. And the hotel gym is to be commended - cardio and treadmills on the first floor (with a Precor machine - my favourite) and weigh machines on the floor below. It's the room itself where you realise the difference - especially with the outdated furnishings and bathroom. But clean nonetheless - and at least there is a flat-screen TV.

Check-in was okay (friendly staff - hence the One Star), but then it went downhill.  The room needs updating (badly).  Things like the carpets are worn, the cupboards bashed... it's just very 'old' and unloved.   While, I could cope with this for the 3 nights I'm here for, it was the fact that I was expected to share my room with a mouse (see picture)  I called down to the front desk who sent someone up immediately.

"Avoid - dated, zero service, zero security","We stayed at Britannia for 2 nights and the experience was awful. First their level of security was horrendous. We checked in late in the afternoon yet later we found the previous hotel guests coming into our room, they claimed to have forgotten something and the receptionist has given them a room card so that they can just in and find it. This level of service is totally unacceptable.  The room itself was small and dated with no windows. The bed was uncomfortable. It was basically a hostel room. The toilet had plumbing issues, it regurgitated some dirty toilet water back up in the middle of the night which landed all over the floor.

Unfortunately by 30 mins later the heater had stll not arrived, so we decided to pack our bags and head for the reception to ask for a refund. We were met by a woman called Lonela, who quite frankly was very unprofessional and rude, and lacked the skill set needed for a pleasent customer service experience, and quite coldly told us ""we would not be getting a refund under any circumstances, "" and went on to say they would offer an alternative with a portable heater.

The Hotel itself was very clean, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The bar overlooking the marina was very relaxing and enjoyable.

Firstly if you don’t like chandeliers, red carpets, gold banisters and mahogany furniture then don’t book here. Yes the hotel is dated but that’s a part of the charm, yes there were some areas that needed a little maintenance but wow what a huge hotel to keep on top of, and ok some of the repairs were rather makeshift like the tape on the sofas, consider throws instead?

Apparently the 1st hotel built in Canary Wharf. Yep - it shows.  Very tired décor.  Black duck tape on Chocolate brown sofas in the seating area. Service was awful. Slow and difficult.

An absolute disgraceful trick. Most (not all) of the staff are surly and unhappy. However, what is really good about this place is the ease of parking, the cost of the rooms and the closeness to O2.

Dreadful, awful, terrible... I could go on. Read the other reviews for details - they are all accurate.   Basically everything a hotel shouldn’t do - you’ll find here.   Every member of staff was rude and clearly didn’t want to be there. I don’t blame them.

Awful awful awful. Avoid,Hands down the worst hotel experience ever. I stayed here about five years ago and swore never again. Well I had a conference in docklands and it was the only available room in budget. 30 min wait to check in. Sheets were not clean. Windowless room. Constant humming noise. Had to rearrange furniture in order to use ironing board. Iron was in poor repair and spat dirty rusty hot water over my shirt.

Awful staff,"I stayed at this hotel in September 2019. The room was as expected. Reasonably clean and the bed had a nice firm mattress. The thing that let this place down the most was the staff. I experienced such a poor attitude from the reception staff and the bar staff. When I got out of the lift to find my room I was greeted by a sea of dirty plates on the floor in the lift lobby. 3hrs later the plates, festering with half-eaten food, as still there.

Dodgy plumbing and lifts!,"Allocated room was very hot and aircon was inadequate. Also, bath/shower waste had severe leak and basin plug was stuck shut. Reception said they would send someone up to look at it. Waited. Phoned again. They said someone was on their way. Waited again. Advised that I would be moved to a different room. Eventually member of staff arrived and took me to new room, which was bigger, cooler and aircon ok.  Water from basin tap was scalding (dangerously) hot. No cold water. Shower worked though. Didn't have time to deal with it as running late due to previous delays.  Also, there was a dirty sock hanging from a light fitting. Cleaners obviously missed it.

Fantastic value for money,"Having read all the reviews,it was a pleasant surprise to find all our worries were non founded. On arrival we were allocated a 5th floor room as my wife does not do lifts, we requested a lower floor not a problem, both duty Managers Amar and Adrian are seasoned in this role, happy hour in the bar 4_6 makes it the cheapest on canary wharf.Food was ok with a choice every day, the breakfast was excellent,never stayed on Canary Wharfe but we will be back make use of the clipper to wizz you up the river or walk the Grenwich foot tunnel to the Meridian.The shopping centre in Canada Square is to be seen to be believed.National express you did well, this 4 day trip was excellent value for money, given that it's travel, dinner bed and breakfast, we will be back.If it could be improved",Date of stay: September 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_40""></span>"
Faulty Towers!!!,Booked The Britannia International Hotel at short notice and wondered why it was so cheap. I then read the reviews on TA so I wasn't surprised when it looked like I'd stepped back in time. The whole hotel is very tired looking with extremely worn and old fashioned furniture. TBH the staff were very friendly and the service was pretty good. Just don't expect a modern 4 star hotel and you won't be disappointed.,Date of stay: September 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Give it a miss,"Check in was constantly busy and the poor girls on reception were stressed (lot of coach holidays were staying). Room was a double which was basically two very small single beds pushed together. Curtains were hanging off, carpet was dirty and overall very run down. Breakfast was ""okay"". Out of three lifts only one was working so if you were on the tenth floor you had to wait 15 mins to get down to reception if you were lucky.   I just could not recommend this unless you wanted somewhere really cheap in London and were not going to spend much time in the hotel. Also whilst not the hotels fault there is a lot of building work going on outside so if you want to lay in past 8am don't book. I won't be staying again.",Date of stay: September 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_10""></span>"
Grim!,"Amazed this hotel has the gall to describe itself as either ‘modern’ or 4 star!  It’s dated and grubby and decidedly ‘brown’ (brown carpets, brown furniture etc). Waited over 20 minutes to check in only to be told the ‘standard double room’ I’d already paid for was just a box room with no space around the bed and would I like to pay £10 more for a different ‘standard double room’ with more space (but couldn’t tell me the size difference!)

Believe me when I say I try to find the positives in hotels. It was hard with this place. We stayed for 7 days.

The positives! 1/ Daily happy hour from 4-6!  2/ The black out curtains - because they work!  3/ We did manage to find a laundrette in the area which saved us money rather than use the exorbitant charges the hotel would have charged to wash socks, undies and hankies.

Nice location,Where do I start because we was a coach trip they made us move close to reception desk and he shouted his instructions then he started to shout our names to get our key card it was like going back in time like you back at school. The room was clean and tidy window is held together by a screw. The bathroom floor has a cracked tile. The food was ok but it would be nice to have a better choice.

The car park awful and costs extortionate. staff including most of managers didn't seem to care only one who helped me when I left.

Redecoration,We stayed here for a week the food was excellent and the staff were good but the hotel could do with a revamp upon reading other people's reviews we were not looking forward to staying here the room was ok and the bed was comfortable but who ever owns it needs to spend some money on redecoration as it is looking tired and worn the hotel is always busy so pheraps in the winter months they could make a start on it,Date of stay: September 2019,"<span class=""ui_bubble_rating bubble_30""></span>"
Shocking Hotel,The Hotel is extremely dated and dirty. The beds are like rocks and the rooms smell stale. The bathroom had mould and fittings were broken. The staff in the pizzeria were pleasant enough but other staff otherwise were rude. It was bad enough that I left early to stay elsewhere and even though I gave them 2-days notice they tried to Claim I hadn’t; I even spotted the member of staff I had spoken to trying to hide in the office.

Staff at central reservations so rude!! Someone hung up on my partner when he asked for a manager.   Rang back and they were still very rude.

Steer clear. Absolutely diabolical.,"Awful hotel.   Got stuck in the lift. The emergency button wasn't working. Our room was on the fifth floor, the lift took us to floor 12 then we had to walk back down 14 flights of stairs. After this, we eventually got into our room. Hideous. Hasn't been redecorated since about 1832 (not even convinced I'm exaggerating) beds were awful. The floor seemed like a more comfy option. And then my partner got locked in the bathroom. Had to call reception to get help. The in room phone wasn't connected. The ""manager"" arrived. And miraculously managed to open the door, first attempt, so clearly this has happened before.
