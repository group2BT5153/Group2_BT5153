0,All ok except the cost of parking We had a budget 2 night stay and its a well set hotel a short walk from the shopping malls in Canary Wharf and 2 minutes from the tube into London. So location is top marks. Service was ok and the room good if a little hot and slightly dated. We had value for  money in the cost. The breakfast was buffet style and eat your heart out. They should serve the coffee though - its help yourself. The parking though is 21 pounds a day so get your card out !!!!!!. So worth a go in location if you have the right deal .We had a great view of the water too- 3rd floor/!!!!!!!!!,1,ok except cost park budget night stay well set hotel short walk shop malls canary wharf minutes tube london location top mark service ok room good little hot slightly date value money cost breakfast buffet style eat heart serve coffee though help park though pound day get card worth go location right deal great view water rd floor

8,"One of Britannia's Best Hotels Arrived on a National Holidays 3 day coach trip.  Was upgraded to a twin room which was quite large and well equipped including an iron & ironing board & a flat screen TV with Freeview channels.  As with all Britannia Hotels the room would benefit greatly from a major refurbishment as the decor is very tired. The major let down in the room (409) was the shower which you could only stand underneath if you are under 5ft tall.  It was also very difficult to get the temperature right.  The food in Jenny's Restaurant was OK, but especially at dinner, it was obvious it was low quality.  The public areas of the hotel are well decorated and furnished to a high standard.  The bar is reasonably priced for London, and all the staff in the hotel were polite and very helpful.

14,cheap/ good location for visiting London ok. so the international isn't going to get an award for best breakfast or swanky rooms but it's adequate and in the brittania style.

15,"Comfortable 1 night stay close to O2 arena We wanted a hotel in a good location for O2 arena at a sensible price. We paid £139 for a double room, no window and no breakfast and I'd say it was a fair price for the location. We were offered a complimentary upgrade to room with window but were told it would be two single mattresses zipped together - they were in fact just twin beds. We didn't really mind as it was a functional stay without much time in the room. It is 10mins walk from Canary Wharf tube and that is one stop away from the O2 - we were there within 25 mins so that was great. The hotel staff were really helpful and check in was fast.

17,"Could be better Our room initially seemed lovely - very spacious and light with the full length windows. A very reasonable price also at £55 for one night (although we had received a complimentary upgrade to a room with a window). However there are a number of things which hindered the room preventing it from a 4* or 5* rating. Firstly our double bed consisted of two single mattresses bolted together. The room was very very warm, and the air conditioning was poor not making the entire room cool and taking an age to do any sort of temperature change. It was also rather noisy. Wifi in rooms also costs £7 per day (!!!!) apart from a free 20 minute session - when every single tube station now has free wifi, how can't a hotel situated right by Canary Wharf not?

Room - old-fashioned and desperately needs refurbishment. There's an old musk smell and a lot of things feel grubby. Although the bed was really comfortable! I woke up happy and rested.  Breakfast was good - buffet - variety of food, different kind of bread, ham, cereals etc. Tastsy. Nice drinks over bar, but old, dirty and smelly sofas to sit on. Not nice.

20,"Grand but a bit run down now I remember when I first moved to London and stayed in this place and it was so grand.  Now, it still has that same grand feel and the bar by the water is always nice but I can't deny that it all felt a little drab.  The room was functional and I have to say not having a plug socket near the bed is completely unacceptable nowadays.  Charging my phone across the room simply isn't on.  Ended up having to move my bed.  Other than that... I'm giving it four stars for nostalgia but really it's a 3 star hotel nowadays.

21,"Grotty, run down and nothing like the photos. We recently stayed here for three nights after booking what was billed as a four star hotel. The hotel is seriously shabby and dirty. The room we were initially given was dirty, mouldy and cold. The beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. The heated swimming pool that looked so lovely in the photos was also dirty and cold. To add insult to injury, there was an additional cost. On request we were moved to a better room but it still didn't feel very four star. The lifts were smelly with the odour of urine and marijuana. The hotel was surrounded by building work (not the hotel's fault but guests should be warned) which impeded access to the hotel. The advertised spa facilities were out of action.

22,Horrible I chose this hotel as had to go to hotel near Canary Wharf. Did not expect much as I got a good rate for London. When I checked in I asked for Internet and the receptionist said that she asked about that by a lot of clients today. How strange nowadays. Then you can only have it free for 20 Minutes in your room. I forgot my charging cable. The hotel did not have one to borrow and was not able to tell me how long shops are open at Canary Wharf.  Very strange for a concierge not to know that and I was under the impression he did not care at all. Coming up to the lifts it smelled of a mixture of Indian cuisine from the restaurant and pool. The furniture and specially the carpets are pretty run down which ok happens after a while.

Putting the aesthetics of the dated and shabby rooms to one side, it is physically unpleasant to be in this hotel. Rooms are  too hot, windows don't open, AC doesn't work and there is no bottled water in the rooms.  You have to pay extra for everything e.g. WiFi, adaptors, gym etc and the staff don't seem to care or do not have the power to put things right. Each time  I went to the foyer it was echoing to the sounds of guests complaining and not getting satisfactory answers. At breakfast we bonded with strangers about just how grim it all was.

Having checked the TripAdvisor website for previous reviews we knew what to expect, and whilst some aspects of the building are tired and in need of refurbishment we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay and would definitely go again. We had a large room on the 7th floor, it didn't have a great view but that didn't bother us. We had a well appointed room, large flatscreen TV, a good sized bathroom with over the bath shower and generous counter top space for all our bits and pieces.

Prebooked parking around a 20 minute walk away as a parking space was not guaranteed due to not being able to pre-book , so it was a bit of a walk.

The hotel is currently going through a phase of refurbishment, but will take some time and a lot of finance.

The food was pretty reasonable, self service breakfast, but evening meal, the main joints of meat were dished out and the portions were quite small. That said the hotel is in a good location to access London city, only a 10 minute walk to use either the DLR (Docklands Light Railway) on the underground itself.

357,"Ignore this at your own peril!! Before staying at this hotel, I decided that I would form my own opinion despite what other reviews said. Big mistake. I came to London with my mam for a nice pre-Christmas break, shopping and sightseeing. The hotel's proximity to the DLR and the underground station are it's only saving graces. The hotel itself looks lovely from the outside, but it's like stepping inside a time warp where nothing really flows cohesively. The first shocker was that you have to pay £7 per day per device for Wi-Fi!!! The staff (except for one chef who always said hello with a smile) are disinterested and, at times, rude. We went into the Friday's bar on Saturday evening which was quiet, but pleasant.

This was the closest hotel left with availability to the O2 on short notice and although it is in need of refurbishment, it was very clean and the staff were polite and friendly.

625,"A very happy stay. For the location this hotel is really good value for money, it's really close to Canary Wharf Underground station. We stayed in a suite which was a good size and the views of Canary wharf were really dramatic. The bed was ok and the room was kept clean and tidy. We were on a dinner, bed and breakfast deal and we were happy with the quality of the food. We paid £7 per day for WiFi in the room which I thought was fair given the good deal we had on the room and food. However, if a family with kids is staying and everybody needs WiFi then be aware that the charge is £7 per device per day when comparing costs. The hotel across the street was double the cost and whilst it's more modern I couldn't justify paying twice as much for the same thing, we prefer to have more spending Money",1,happy stay location hotel really good value money really close canary wharf underground station stay suite good size view canary wharf really dramatic bed ok room keep clean tidy dinner bed breakfast deal happy quality food pay per day wifi room think fair give good deal room food however family kid stay everybody need wifi aware charge per device per day compare cost hotel across street double cost whilst modern could not justify pay twice much thing prefer spend money

As we came to our floor directly outside the lift we saw a dirty food tray on the floor which hadn’t been moved and directly outside our room we had booked there was a dirty glass.   The bedding itself was dirty. There was black marks on the duvet cover (there version of getting rid of it is by turning the duvet round for day two) and the duvet barely covers the full bed I had to sleep nearly on my boyfriend’s side of the bed to ensure I had a decent amount of duvet.,0,cheap not cheerful arrive tell phone not need pay park check annoy find need pay also go room saw one cleaners sit floor phone not even manners say hello come floor directly outside lift saw dirty food tray floor not move directly outside room book dirty glass bed dirty black mark duvet cover version get rid turn duvet round day two duvet barely cover full bed sleep nearly boyfriends side bed ensure decent amount duvet

660,"Lovely hotel and EXCELLENT value for London My wife and I love this hotel and stay here whenever we are in London. I stayed here first when on business, and chose the hotel basically because it was the only reasonably-priced hotel within easy travelling distance of central London that wasn't some kind of hostel. In the past, I have had terrible experiences with London hotels; anything less than £120/night in the Westminster/Paddington area tends to be a room about 9 foot by 6, usually located so close to the Tube that you feel like an additional station. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Britannia, but to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.   This is a beautiful hotel. Other reviewers have called the decor ""dated"", but this is very misleading -- it doesn't look like a hotel from 30 years ago; it",1,lovely hotel excellent value london wife love hotel stay whenever london stay first business choose hotel basically reasonablypriced hotel within easy travel distance central london not kind hostel past terrible experience london hotels anything less night westminsterpaddington area tend room foot usually locate close tube feel like additional station not sure expect britannia say pleasantly surprise would understatement beautiful hotel reviewers call decor date mislead not look like hotel years ago

701,"Simple and clean This hotel had a very nice appearance- the bling of the gold staircase when you enter does not disappoint the eye. Our room was a big double room (with no window, but we didn't mind) and had a spacious shower room.  Although the walls are quite thin, we had no disturbance overnight, the only thing being the tinkling of a piano at 8 in the morning as we were on the 1st floor, which I found lovely to wake up to. We did not use the pool facilities but for only 4 pounds per person extra, I believe that this would definitely be worthwhile if there for a couple of nights or with a family. It did what it said on the tin and I would stay here again.

702,"Surprisingly good budget stay in London The hotel is just a short walk away from Canary Wharf shops and offices, very easy to get to. We booked an inside room (my wife came with me for some shopping while I went to work), which was incredibly cheap, so I wasn't expecting much. We were upgraded to an outside room at check-in which was great. The decor is VERY dated with dark colored wood panelling and soft furnishings, but the room itself was absolutely fine, nice and spacious, clean and a decent bathroom. The only potential downside for others is that the rooms on the right side of the hotel (east), which is where we were, face a growing building site, which will probably get very noisy as it  grows upwards. But it was still quite low when we stayed there and we were above all the noise, so no issue for us.

The guy sighed and eye rolled!  Breakfast - they have signs to say when it's most busy, but it doesn't matter what time you go, the room is too small to accommodate the number of guests.

The room was a bit dated but very clean and the bedding was sparkling white and spotless.  Bed was comfy and the shower was good. The food was tasty and of reasonable quality for a hot buffet. One criticism is there are no signs on or above food to say what it is so you have a bit of guesswork before you pick what you want! We noticed the next morning that there was a blackboard stating what food was on but as this wasn't pointed out we hadn't noticed it the evening before. That said Breakfast was very good.

But I couldn't stay longer than a week, and I only stayed a week because there was a no cancellation policy.

932,only thing worse than the rooms is the service Not only is the check in service exceptionally slow but it took me 3 attempts to get a room I would consider staying in and that’s mostly just because I got sick of waiting at reception (15-20 minutes each time). Not to mention I never got an apology for the inconvenience or more than 10 words spoke to me total over the 3 visits to reception. My first room I found pubes in the bed. The second bed looked to have mouldy sheets and to there credit they did upgrade me to a room with a window but one that had two single beds one of which at least looked clean enough to sleep in (at least that’s what I’m telling my self). However the view from the window isn’t what I’d call a selling point at the ceiling in the bathroom had damp mouldy patches.

Personal at reception made every tiny little thing into a massive one, refusing to be helpful and making up, let me talk to my manager, the most tedious words in the whole world.

When we returned in the evening however it was quite the opposite, the room stank of the smell of smoke despite asking for a non-smoking room. What was noticeably worse was the sounds of the nearby train station running until midnight, and starting again in the early hours of the morning. This resulted in my partner and I having very little sleep throughout the night, as the trains sounded like a low flying aircraft passing over every 20 minutes.

Fair enough if you just want a place to rest your head, but for the prices charged, you'd be much better off elsewhere. I was staying on business and was upgraded to a pretty large room with a decent view, but if it was me paying I'd have gone elsewhere.  Plus points - good location for Canary Wharf, staff were pleasant enough. Bad points - hotel is very dated and has a general air of neglect.

There were also exposed wires in and outside the lifts.  The hotel staff, although nice, were incredibly slow and it took a long while to get served at the bar.

Staff were friendly and I had got the room for a bargain. We had purchased the double room (with no window & no breakfast) for one night as we were going to s concert at the o2.  Pros: Very clean room, comfortable bed, complimentary toiletries and no noise could be heard from the other rooms. Although no window, there was air con so it didn't feel stuffy. Very helpful and friendly cleaners.  Cons: Parking costs £21 for 24hrs before 6pm and £15 after. I suppose they have to make their money somewhere but I though it to be steep.

1361,"Very old fashioned - be warned! Stayed here three nights, had never heard of it before but was the most reasonably priced hotel in area, and I needed to make a booking quickly without doing more research. Location is great, short 10 min walk to Canary Wharf shops and offices. It's cheaper than other hotels in the vicinity.  But beware- you get what you pay for!

It was cold, and no attempts with the air conditioner could avoid me having to wear extra clothing in bed to keep warm.  The hotel charges for EVERYTHING.

The receptionist then told me she was going to give me a complimentary upgrade to a double with as window(I booked double without). Then she made me feel like I pushed her to give me an upgrade when I didn’t even want one, she said “just so you know, next time you won’t be getting an upgrade as this was a once off”.

1633,Shocking Hotel The Hotel is extremely dated and dirty. The beds are like rocks and the rooms smell stale. The bathroom had mould and fittings were broken. The staff in the pizzeria were pleasant enough but other staff otherwise were rude. It was bad enough that I left early to stay elsewhere and even though I gave them 2-days notice they tried to Claim I hadn’t; I even spotted the member of staff I had spoken to trying to hide in the office.

Our room was on the fifth floor, the lift took us to floor 12 then we had to walk back down 14 flights of stairs. After this, we eventually got into our room. Hideous. Hasn't been redecorated since about 1832 (not even convinced I'm exaggerating) beds were awful. The floor seemed like a more comfy option. And then my partner got locked in the bathroom. Had to call reception to get help. The in room phone wasn't connected. The ""manager"" arrived. And miraculously managed to open the door, first attempt, so clearly this has happened before.

The room we were in was spacious and had everything we needed but was just very outdated. It did have a fabulous view of the modern buildings and water so I can't fault that.
