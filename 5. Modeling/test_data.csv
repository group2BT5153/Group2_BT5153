0,All ok except the cost of parking We had a budget 2 night stay and its a well set hotel a short walk from the shopping malls in Canary Wharf and 2 minutes from the tube into London. So location is top marks. Service was ok and the room good if a little hot and slightly dated. We had value for  money in the cost. The breakfast was buffet style and eat your heart out. They should serve the coffee though - its help yourself. The parking though is 21 pounds a day so get your card out !!!!!!. So worth a go in location if you have the right deal .We had a great view of the water too- 3rd floor/!!!!!!!!!,1,ok except cost park budget night stay well set hotel short walk shop malls canary wharf minutes tube london location top mark service ok room good little hot slightly date value money cost breakfast buffet style eat heart serve coffee though help park though pound day get card worth go location right deal great view water rd floor

8,"One of Britannia's Best Hotels Arrived on a National Holidays 3 day coach trip.  Was upgraded to a twin room which was quite large and well equipped including an iron & ironing board & a flat screen TV with Freeview channels.  As with all Britannia Hotels the room would benefit greatly from a major refurbishment as the decor is very tired. The major let down in the room (409) was the shower which you could only stand underneath if you are under 5ft tall.  It was also very difficult to get the temperature right.  The food in Jenny's Restaurant was OK, but especially at dinner, it was obvious it was low quality.  The public areas of the hotel are well decorated and furnished to a high standard.  The bar is reasonably priced for London, and all the staff in the hotel were polite and very helpful.

14,cheap/ good location for visiting London ok. so the international isn't going to get an award for best breakfast or swanky rooms but it's adequate and in the brittania style.

15,"Comfortable 1 night stay close to O2 arena We wanted a hotel in a good location for O2 arena at a sensible price. We paid Â£139 for a double room, no window and no breakfast and I'd say it was a fair price for the location. We were offered a complimentary upgrade to room with window but were told it would be two single mattresses zipped together - they were in fact just twin beds. We didn't really mind as it was a functional stay without much time in the room. It is 10mins walk from Canary Wharf tube and that is one stop away from the O2 - we were there within 25 mins so that was great. The hotel staff were really helpful and check in was fast.

17,"Could be better Our room initially seemed lovely - very spacious and light with the full length windows. A very reasonable price also at Â£55 for one night (although we had received a complimentary upgrade to a room with a window). However there are a number of things which hindered the room preventing it from a 4* or 5* rating. Firstly our double bed consisted of two single mattresses bolted together. The room was very very warm, and the air conditioning was poor not making the entire room cool and taking an age to do any sort of temperature change. It was also rather noisy. Wifi in rooms also costs Â£7 per day (!!!!) apart from a free 20 minute session - when every single tube station now has free wifi, how can't a hotel situated right by Canary Wharf not?

Room - old-fashioned and desperately needs refurbishment. There's an old musk smell and a lot of things feel grubby. Although the bed was really comfortable! I woke up happy and rested.  Breakfast was good - buffet - variety of food, different kind of bread, ham, cereals etc. Tastsy. Nice drinks over bar, but old, dirty and smelly sofas to sit on. Not nice.

20,"Grand but a bit run down now I remember when I first moved to London and stayed in this place and it was so grand.  Now, it still has that same grand feel and the bar by the water is always nice but I can't deny that it all felt a little drab.  The room was functional and I have to say not having a plug socket near the bed is completely unacceptable nowadays.  Charging my phone across the room simply isn't on.  Ended up having to move my bed.  Other than that... I'm giving it four stars for nostalgia but really it's a 3 star hotel nowadays.

21,"Grotty, run down and nothing like the photos. We recently stayed here for three nights after booking what was billed as a four star hotel. The hotel is seriously shabby and dirty. The room we were initially given was dirty, mouldy and cold. The beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. The heated swimming pool that looked so lovely in the photos was also dirty and cold. To add insult to injury, there was an additional cost. On request we were moved to a better room but it still didn't feel very four star. The lifts were smelly with the odour of urine and marijuana. The hotel was surrounded by building work (not the hotel's fault but guests should be warned) which impeded access to the hotel. The advertised spa facilities were out of action.

22,Horrible I chose this hotel as had to go to hotel near Canary Wharf. Did not expect much as I got a good rate for London. When I checked in I asked for Internet and the receptionist said that she asked about that by a lot of clients today. How strange nowadays. Then you can only have it free for 20 Minutes in your room. I forgot my charging cable. The hotel did not have one to borrow and was not able to tell me how long shops are open at Canary Wharf.  Very strange for a concierge not to know that and I was under the impression he did not care at all. Coming up to the lifts it smelled of a mixture of Indian cuisine from the restaurant and pool. The furniture and specially the carpets are pretty run down which ok happens after a while.

Putting the aesthetics of the dated and shabby rooms to one side, it is physically unpleasant to be in this hotel. Rooms are  too hot, windows don't open, AC doesn't work and there is no bottled water in the rooms.  You have to pay extra for everything e.g. WiFi, adaptors, gym etc and the staff don't seem to care or do not have the power to put things right. Each time  I went to the foyer it was echoing to the sounds of guests complaining and not getting satisfactory answers. At breakfast we bonded with strangers about just how grim it all was.

We had a large room on the 7th floor, it didn't have a great view but that didn't bother us.

Prebooked parking around a 20 minute walk away as a parking space was not guaranteed due to not being able to pre-book , so it was a bit of a walk.

No issues with the room initially, it was comfy albeit a little dated. Went to the Britney concert no issues and had a few drinks. Returned to the hotel ready to sleep after a long night out.

The food was pretty reasonable, self service breakfast, but evening meal, the main joints of meat were dished out and the portions were quite small.

I came in the evening to check in and a member of staff â likely Hispanic from his accent â mentioned if I would like a room with windows and reassured me the room would be quiet facing towards the road. I knew this to be a street in busy Canary Wharf but as he did reassure that the room would be quiet, I agreed. However, it was noisy at night with traffic and people shouting from nightâs out so did not get a good nightâs rest.

583,STAY CLEAR Reception staff were welcoming and polite. I paid a high premium because the O2 arena had the NTA awards. The receptionist offered a room upgrade ( an additional price to pay ) which was a room with a window and a view of the river. The river view was almost non existent. The room was clean but in need of decorating. It was the most uncomfortable nights sleep ( not a lot ) that I can remember. The bed / mattress was the worst that I have slept on.

625,"A very happy stay. For the location this hotel is really good value for money, it's really close to Canary Wharf Underground station. We stayed in a suite which was a good size and the views of Canary wharf were really dramatic. The bed was ok and the room was kept clean and tidy. We were on a dinner, bed and breakfast deal and we were happy with the quality of the food. We paid Â£7 per day for WiFi in the room which I thought was fair given the good deal we had on the room and food. However, if a family with kids is staying and everybody needs WiFi then be aware that the charge is Â£7 per device per day when comparing costs.

I stayed here first when on business, and chose the hotel basically because it was the only reasonably-priced hotel within easy travelling distance of central London that wasn't some kind of hostel. In the past, I have had terrible experiences with London hotels; anything less than Â£120/night in the Westminster/Paddington area tends to be a room about 9 foot by 6, usually located so close to the Tube that you feel like an additional station. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Britannia, but to say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.   This is a beautiful hotel.

696,No time for cooked breakfast again!! Stayed at this hotel 4 years ago and my review is pretty similar so disappointed they have not sorted the breakfast out. The hotel is fine and in a good position but the queuing for breakfast is apalling. There were approximately 60 people queuing for the breakfast at 8am. I remembered from last time that you could get toast and cereal by going to the front of the queue as the big queue was for the cooked food. There are no signs or anyone to tell you this so everyone coming to breakfast just joins the one queue. Again never had time to have a cooked breakfast as taking too long and had a coach to catch. Hope we don't stay here again as look forward to a cooked breakfast when away from home.,0,time cook breakfast stay hotel years ago review pretty similar disappoint not sort breakfast hotel fine good position queue breakfast apalling approximately people queue breakfast remember last time could get toast cereal go front queue big queue cook food sign anyone tell everyone come breakfast join one queue never time cook breakfast take long coach catch hope not stay look forward cook breakfast away home

702,"Surprisingly good budget stay in London The hotel is just a short walk away from Canary Wharf shops and offices, very easy to get to. We booked an inside room (my wife came with me for some shopping while I went to work), which was incredibly cheap, so I wasn't expecting much. We were upgraded to an outside room at check-in which was great. The decor is VERY dated with dark colored wood panelling and soft furnishings, but the room itself was absolutely fine, nice and spacious, clean and a decent bathroom. The only potential downside for others is that the rooms on the right side of the hotel (east), which is where we were, face a growing building site, which will probably get very noisy as it  grows upwards.

The staff members at the reception and conceigage were very friendly as well.   We had issues with the room smelling terribly bad due to a part of the carpet always being wet. The facilities of the bathroom were not that great either.  The door was jammed and the toilet would not flush.

We noticed the next morning that there was a blackboard stating what food was on but as this wasn't pointed out we hadn't noticed it the evening before. That said Breakfast was very good.

852,The hotel in the docks. We stayed in this hotel on a visit to the Chelsea flower show with national holidays. At this point I must say that most of the reviews of the hotel were inaccurate  in my opinion and some grossly malicious. We had a room on the eighth floor overlooking the novatel  hotel. Our room was clean and spacious but the furniture was dated which didn't bother us. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable and we had a good night's sleep. The restaurant was on the canal side and we always tried to get a table by the window. The service was good  and all the staff were polite and helpful.

925,"Good location, but tired To be fair, we booked this hotel as an online deal and didn't expect too much for the price we paid.  We had a deal which included a bottle of house wine, which was ok quality.  We were very surprised that our room included a wrought iron spiral staircase to access the bedroom and bathroom, which was not good for guests with mobility problems or ladies with high heels (me!).  The hotel could do with being rather cleaner than it was and we understood that building work was ongoing,  however much of the furnishing and interior needed upgrading.  Buffet breakfast was ok, not exceptional, we noted that chips for breakfast was an unusual touch.

Along with most reviews, it is somewhat dated but for the price it is good value. The location is excellent for the city and the O2 Arena. The Jubilee Line is only a short walk away and there is a large retail outlet underground by the station.  Because of all the new build works around, we were awoken early in the morning.  Since we are here for pleasure rather than business, that was a bit of a pain.   The room was basic.  Oddly, the two pictures on the wall, were SO random and dissimilar, that I can only imagine  they were put up in the dark.  They had no connection to London, Docklands or even Britain.

1043,"Disgusting Hotel, Shady Business I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, and the only positive things I can say about this hotel is its decent location and the relatively large size of the rooms (comparative to other hotels in London).  Unfortunately, everything else is negative.  First, do not be tricked by the photos on their website, or other hotel booking sites, because the photos are about 30 years old.  The carpet is falling apart, in rooms as well as in public spaces, and the wall paper is peeling everywhere.  Furniture is old and scuffed.  Rooms smell like old musk and and mold.  It looks like a hotel that once was in its prime 30 years ago and was never refurbished or cared for afterwards.  Everything was sticky and disgusting in the rooms.  Second, housekeeping is shady.

When we returned in the evening however it was quite the opposite, the room stank of the smell of smoke despite asking for a non-smoking room.

This resulted in my partner and I having very little sleep throughout the night, as the trains sounded like a low flying aircraft passing over every 20 minutes.

1082,London and Kensington Palace We booked with National Travel to go to London and Kensington Palace to see the Princess Diana exhibition of her dresses. It was a very early start 6am from Middlesbrough we arrived in London about 1.30 pm ish and were dropped off to explore the city. We had to return to the coach at 4.30pm and travelled to the Britania International Hotel over in Docklands (Canary Wharf) the hotel looked quite good and our rooms were more than adequate. The evening meal was ok but if you liked beef it was only suitable for repairing shoes ughh.  Thankfully the breakfast was very good and set us up for the day. The coach collected us at 9.30 and we set off for Kensington Palace it took quite a while getting through the traffic and the driver had to collect the tickets which showed our entrance,1,london kensington palace book national travel go london kensington palace see princess diana exhibition dress early start middlesbrough arrive london pm ish drop explore city return coach pm travel britania international hotel docklands canary wharf hotel look quite good room adequate even meal ok like beef suitable repair shoe ughh thankfully breakfast good set us day coach collect us set kensington palace take quite get traffic driver collect ticket show entrance

What a lovely room we were given and couldnt believe on entering the room we were faced with a spiral staircase. The room was large and airy and the view from the 11th floor was lovely. The bed was a little uncomfortable for me but maybe not for other people. We had all that we required in the room for our very short stay. We had a buffet style meal in the evening and also breakfast which we felt was value for money. Would strongly recommend this hotel as it is a short walk to the underground station where we needed to go to get right into the heart of London.,1,overnight stay celebrate anniversary upgrade due special day celebrate lovely room give could not believe enter room face spiral staircase room large airy view th floor lovely bed little uncomfortable maybe not people require room short stay buffet style meal even also breakfast felt value money would strongly recommend hotel short walk underground station need go get right heart london

1122,"Better than I feared... ... reading other reviews.  This is the oldest active hotel in Canary Wharf and once in, it shows. The style is very much mid XX century four star, with abundance of fake stuccos, carpets and velvet. Some of the carpets in common areas are very worn and not that clean. However the looks are generally good and my 9th floor room was above my expectations, relatively large, good aspect (very much my memories of 1970âs upper class hotels), clean although the seat of one armchair was completely ripped. Bed a little stiff.  Breakfast buffet abundant, but quality so and so.  All in all, perfectly acceptable and you need to recognize that price is about half of all the surrounding modern chain three-four stars, hence my rating based on relative value.",1,better fear read review oldest active hotel canary wharf show style much mid xx century four star abundance fake stucco carpet velvet carpet common areas wear not clean however look generally good th floor room expectations relatively large good aspect much memories upper class hotels clean although seat one armchair completely rip bed little stiff breakfast buffet abundant quality perfectly acceptable need recognize price half surround modern chain threefour star hence rat base relative value

The room was stifling, we couldn't open any of the windows and so our first night's sleep was pretty poor.  The following day the sink plug was rectified.

There was no ventilation at all so it was very warm. We were offered a Â£20 per night upgrade to a room with a window which we rejected. However, after a really warm night (the radiator was at 5 when we arrived) we asked for a change. The thing that did it was that the room across had had smokers in it. The way the hotel âcleansâ the air isnât to open the window in that room, itâs to open the door instead. So the smoky sir just went cross the corridor to the room with no ventilation.

The carpets were the same my Nan and Grandad had when they were alive all them years ago. The shower curtain posed a bigger risk than knife crime to us and the chair that only had three working legs wasn't far behind.   The hair dryer was broken and after requesting a new one on two occasions we are still waiting. 2019 is the earliest it's likely to arrive would be my guess.

1277,Tired hotel in need of a refurbish or rebuild I stayed here for three nights in November 18 and was not impressed. My room was below par: the air conditioning didnât work meaning it was constantly over 27 degrees. There were few electrical sockets and one was not well fixed so the plug would not connect properly. The TV had been installed as an afterthought with a cable trailing across the wall. WiFi in the room is limited to 40 minutes a day. My windows hadnât been cleaned for many months.  Though some of my colleagues were even more unlucky with no a/c at all and no windows either.   Basically itâs an ageing hotel that needs refurbishment or demolition for something more suitable for this hi-tech area.,0,tire hotel need refurbish rebuild stay three nights november not impress room par air condition not work mean constantly degrees electrical sockets one not well fix plug would not connect properly tv instal afterthought cable trail across wall wifi room limit minutes day windows not clean many months though colleagues even unlucky ac windows either basically age hotel need refurbishment demolition something suitable hitech area
1278,"Uncomfortable Bed I stayed at here last night, before a flight out of LCY (15 mins away by taxi). So obviously for me the location was handy, and it's also right by Canary Wharf with easy access to the rest of London by DLR and the Jubilee line. First impressions were very good--the facade and lobby are grand and welcoming. Check in was very very slow, with a long queue. That said the receptionist who checked me in was friendly and helpful. Arriving on the 1st floor, those good impressions quickly faded- the corridors are drab, dreary and run down. My room, however, was better than I had expected - very spacious, with a floor to ceiling/wall to wall window, large separate sitting area with a sofa and two armchairs, plenty of desk space and 2 wardrobes.

It is one of the cheaper hotels in the area and I believe it was good value for money. The breakfast room and bar are both level with the water and have a great view while eating.  While some may see the decor as dated and carpets a bit worn, I really like the period feel, It is definitely not modern and has a very eighties feel, and I appreciated that it was something different and unique - pleasant change.  The room was well sound insulated and I slept very well both nights.

1503,Great weekend but few let downs! We recently had a fantastic week in London and stayed at this hotel for the duration of our stay. The hotel was in a great location for what we needed and overall we had a pleasant stay. However there were a few things that we would not have expected and were disappointed about for the money that we paid.  - The shower never stayed at one temperature and was constantly in and out of hot water. - There was mould behind the taps in the bath. - The tv remote didn't work. - The jacuzzi in the spa wasn't working but we weren't made aware of this before we paid to use the facilities. - The towels were tiny......feel sorry for anyone that was over a size 10 because it barely covered me!  These are all minor things but things that contribute to whether a stay is good or not and for the,0,great weekend let recently fantastic week london stay hotel duration stay hotel great location need overall pleasant stay however things would not expect disappoint money pay shower never stay one temperature constantly hot water mould behind tap bath tv remote not work jacuzzi spa not work not make aware pay use facilities towel tinyfeel sorry anyone size barely cover minor things things contribute whether stay good not
