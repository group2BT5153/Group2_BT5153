Checking in itself was quick and efficient, staff member was friendly. Had to wait a while for the lift, got to my room only to find the key didn't work. I was tired and aching so that didn't go down well, a member of staff walked by and when i told him i was informed i had to go back to reception to get it changed. Waited ages for the lift again. Got to reception and definitely wasn't joining the back of the queue so went to reception desk and tried to get someones attention but was completely ignored, not happy now!! Fortunately the member of staff who served me handed me another key as soon as he had the opportunity. Once in the room, i felt good, nice room, lovely view and a tempting jacuzzi. Water was very slow to fill but that gave me a chance to have a cuppa and sit looking at the view. Jacuzzi worked but noisy and not very powerful, was good to be able to soak though. Bathroom furniture is a bit dated and could definitely do with an upgrade but was sufficient. Bed was too hard for me but for those that don't mind a firm bed you should be ok, I just had to be a bit inventive and as it was warm in the room I folded the quilt and slept on that with the sheet over me. Would probably go elsewhere next time as for me the bed is the dealbreaker, otherwise I would return.",mostly good couple constructive criticisms book email hotel twice reply arrival little wait check problem walk miles blister sit wait check quick efficient staff member friendly wait lift get room find key not work tire ache not go well member staff walk tell inform go back reception get change wait age lift get reception definitely not join back queue go reception desk try get someone attention completely ignore not happy fortunately member staff serve hand another key soon opportunity room felt good nice room lovely view tempt jacuzzi water slow fill give chance cuppa sit look view jacuzzi work noisy not powerful good able soak though bathroom furniture bite date could definitely upgrade sufficient bed hard not mind firm bed ok bite inventive warm room fold quilt sleep sheet would probably go elsewhere next time bed dealbreaker otherwise would return,1

Reasonable parking charges for a location so close to central London. Really easy to find, a little roadworks to negotiate but well mapped out and on Waze sat nav with precise location.
Easy check-in at reception - no complicated form filling all done from electronic online booking and simple checkout post-box.
Spacious rooms with lots of storage for long stays. Fully equipped with tea/coffee, iron, toiletries etc. We booked a ""room with no view"" as we were on a budget and for just one night we did not need views etc, but found our room to have a window and view of the hotel front which was a pleasant surprise.
We ate in the lounge bar from the pizzeria - reasonably priced in comparison to what you would pay at a take-away and cheaper than the major chain pizza restaurants.

Bath was cracked and stained, exposed gap filler foam along the bottom edge. Air conditioning thermostat did not change the temperature despite several attempts; room temp was stuck on 24c. Mattress springs could be felt. Pillows were thin and lumpy. Sheets were worn and nearly see through. Iron was poor quality and leaked. Ironing board had no padding left and was a thing cotton cover on the metal frame.
Ammenities were minimal. The ‚Äòfree wi-fi‚Äô advertised is available in the foyer only, or 20mins in your room, misleading. Power point near tv had been jammed into the wall and didnt work. I couldn‚Äôt get laundry done overnight, despite only staying in the hotel for one night.
On checkin staff told me no non-smoking rooms were available and they tried to put me in a room with two single beds when i had paid up front for a room with a queen size bed. I had to sternly protest before they relented, literally having to tell them its not my problem if they cant provide what i have booked and paid. They then eventually ‚Äòupgraded‚Äô me to the room as per the description above, which is purportedly 125GBP more expensive per night. I would not like to have seen my original room!

Do not book this hotel. The entire place is filthy. The rooms stink of stale cigarettes.

The electrical appliances have undated test certificates - if any at all. Ironing board covered in black streaks and unusable. The iron was stained black too. Carpets filthy. Big Queues at check in due to every single person ahead of me complaining about hidden extras, obscure rules, foul smells, poor food, invalid vouchers. The ‚Äòwould you like upgrade to a room with a window‚Äô gag was tried on everyone that checked in for the 20 minutes my process took. Some said yes and were charged extra. Those who said no were then ‚Äòupgraded as our gift to you‚Äô. It‚Äôs all a con. There probably aren‚Äôt any rooms with no window. Read the Ts and Cs and be aware before you book - they are obscure and used to trap you. There is a reason why a 4 star hotel has a no cancellation policy - it‚Äôs because everyone tries to cancel when they see what they booked. When a supposed 4 star hotel is available on the heart of Canary Wharf for an unbelievably low price, and all around are at least double the price, it should ring alarm bells.

BUT the Wi Fi is not working at All let alone slowly, as you can see by the photos I tried at different times and yes, your reception was notified. So, I‚Äôve had to use all my 10gb plus Internet Data. Your site: Wi-Fi - Free in public areas; available in every room, 2 x 20 minute complimentary sessions per day, unlimited access ¬£7 per 24 hours per device. BUT None? Bathroom: In need of some filler and paint on the wall its very poor d√©cor. The Toilet flushing system is terrible. You flush once and if need again the system does not fill back up again for a good few minutes. No other hotel with your expected calibre does this, it usually quite instant. The flusher itself is loose and poor. And it would be nice to choose if I want the Toilet seat up. See I have an ileostomy bag and to empty it I usually lift the seat so I have full access to the toilet and do not want any mess on the seat. I struggled as the seat kept falling down and the lid was no better. I‚Äôm surprised this has not until now I presume, that your Maintenance Team have not had this reported to them? Or have they?

We decided to put this behind us and enjoy our stay when my Fianc√©e and I where confronted in the lift on the 8th Floor by two pitbull dogs and their owner. My partner has a fear of dogs and to be locked in a lift 8 floors up with these two agressive hyperactive dogs was a total disgrace! My Fianc√©e was left shaken and scared for what was suppose to be a relaxing holiday!
Secondly, the heating was not working in our Room. We had to endure the 1st night in terrible conditions with 1 light blanket. Despite numerous switchboard/reception calls and finally a meeting with Hotel Manager the following morning and highlighting my Fianc√©e Health Issues as a (Cancer patient) and agreeing to install two portable heaters in our room as its was a 'Maintenance Issue' thats all they could do. My Fianc√®e and I where dissapointed to return to our rooms for the second night to yet again no heating, nor any heaters. The heaters finally arrived to our room at 01.40am on our last night - somewhat 5hrs before our Checkout. 
This was both my Fianc√©e and I first visit to London for our anniversary . As it was a short weekend break, the events that occured created a negative vibe on the weekend.

Meeting my colleagues in the Pizzeria, we were treated to some of the finest frozen pizza possibly sourced as a bankruptcy job lot from Kerry Katona's last engagement with Iceland...
Out to the lounge to get access to non-existent WiFi and we lounge in the luxurious ripped sofas surrounded by the views of Rat Poison bait and an aroma that drifted between feet and vomit...
Needless to say we passed on the promised eastern delights of Spice restaurant ... but we needn't have worried as when we returned to the hotel that evening it seems one of the guests/victims left what could only be described as a fine deposit in the Mens which filled the lobby and entrance to the usefully titled BAR with the full aroma of a medieval Nepali sewerage system... an olfactory delight you could literally taste in the air.

Das Hotel selbst hat mich positiv √ºberrascht - der morbide Charme wurde ja schon von anderen erw√§hnt. Wenn man keinen Luxus erwartet und einen die eine oder andere zerbrochen Fliese im Bad oder ein wackeliges Bett nicht st√∂ren, f√ºr den ist das Hotel eine wirklich gute Wahl. Einchecken, auschecken, Koffer bei Ankunft morgens ins Deposit geben ‚Äì das alles hat gut und rasch funktioniert. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gef√ºhlt. Gefr√ºhst√ºckt haben wir nicht im Hotel, in London kann man das prima unterwegs tun. Auch gibt es in der Shopping Mall nette Caf√©s, u.a. ein Starbucks Caf√©, wer mag.

- Bett war ziemlich unbequem, Kissen sehr flach. Habe an der Reception nach einem anderen Kissen gefragt. Sie hatten kein anderes und gaben mir dasselbe (nach 40 Minuten).
- Keine Klimaanlage, nur ein Kleiner Ventilator. F√ºr den Sommer ist dieses Hotel nicht geeignet. Im Winter hat man eine Heizung. Doch durch den grossen Spalt unter der T√ºre kam die K√§lte rein. Habe jede Nacht den Spalt mit einem Handtuch gestopft, da es sonst zu kalt wurde.
- Wir hatten ein sehr einfaches Zimmer ohne Fenster (wie gebucht). Doch das Zimmer war nicht sauber und es roch immer komisch, da der Teppich nicht sauber war. Wir hatten ein Badezimmer f√ºr Behinderte, obwohl wir kein solches ben√∂tigten. Das Waschbecken war sehr klein und sehr tief unten. Man konnte sich selbst die H√§nde nicht richtig waschen.

8932,"The description of the room on the booking.com website was misleading. We opted for the room without the window, but there was no explanation that the room was actually underneath the ground floor (bear in mind that there are 12 floors). Unfortunately, my friend had some panic attacks during the night due to the lack of air. When we went to the reception to explain what was going on, they were not helpful at all. They said that at midnight there was no house keeping around and so we could not change the room. How come a 4 stars hotel has no housekeeping at night? They did not even try to help or to understand, they categorly said no without really trying. It was quite an emergency, but they did not seem to care. We had to wait the next day to change room. We asked for two pillows to help my friend sleep and we had to wait 40 minutes. There was no communication withint the receptionists, every single time we had to explain the issue. Eventually, we managed to change the room, but until the end, we did not know which was the room number. In order to avoid this issue again, I would suggest to organise the staff differently to be able to have a room ready at night if necessary. There should always be someone for house keeping 24/7. It was a very serious reason, something should have been done immediately. This caused a lot of discomfort to my friend and made us feel uncomfortable.",description room bookingcom website mislead opt room without window explanation room actually underneath grind floor bear mind floor unfortunately friend panic attack night due lack air go reception explain go not helpful say midnight house keep around could not change room come star hotel housekeep night not even try help understand categorly say without really try quite emergency not seem care wait next day change room ask two pillow help friend sleep wait minutes communication withint receptionists every single time explain issue eventually manage change room end not know room number order avoid issue would suggest organise staff differently able room ready night necessary always someone house keep serious reason something immediately cause lot discomfort friend make us feel uncomfortable,0

9921,"A wonderful place to stay maybe, back in about 1995. My advice to you now is to AVOID and be prepared to cough up a couple of hundred quid a week more & stay else-where locally.
Our week's stay got off to a poor start with a stroppy receptionist who wouldn't book us in unless we had a Booking.com reference number. We'd never been asked for this anywhere else & after making this clear she pulled out a card with our name on it. She then rejected our credit card saying we couldn't use it (Bank of Scotland) and we'd have to offer another, despite the fact the hotel had deducted ¬£90 from the same card the day prior to our arrival.
The room was a disgrace, see attched images. Its an insult to Canary Wharf.
Upon entering we noticed the carpet loose; enough to peel it back with the toe of your shoe. It was also very old and frayed. The wardrobe was a joke. The hangers they supply inside it are about an inch too wide for the space, resulting in them hanging at an angle off the rail. The wardrobes are cheap mirror doors in tracks, so if you remove a garment from the hanger & straighten the hanger in the process, it forces the door away & out of its track. The doors were almost impossible to slide, unless you spent time re-fixing them. The bathroom door was worn and lacked varnish. The bath towels were almost too small to go round the waist of even a slim male like myself. At least there was decent water pressure & plenty of hot water.
The table lampshades were damaged, excessively so & unsightly. The bedside cabinets were old with glass tops to protect them, however, the glass had over time scored tears in the wallpaper. There was scribble on one wall extending to around 5 to 6 feet.
The lift was shaky & squeaked going down & the noise of the squeak transmitted itself along the ducting to our room, to the point of waking us, often.",wonderful place stay maybe back advice avoid prepare cough couple hundred quid week stay elsewhere locally weeks stay get poor start stroppy receptionist would not book us unless bookingcom reference number would never ask anywhere else make clear pull card name reject credit card say could not use bank scotland would offer another despite fact hotel deduct card day prior arrival room disgrace see attched image insult canary wharf upon enter notice carpet loose enough peel back toe shoe also old fray wardrobe joke hangers supply inside inch wide space result hang angle rail wardrobes cheap mirror doors track remove garment hanger straighten hanger process force door away track doors almost impossible slide unless spend time refixing bathroom door wear lack varnish bath towel almost small go round waist even slim male like least decent water pressure plenty hot water table lampshades damage excessively unsightly bedside cabinets old glass top protect however glass time score tear wallpaper scribble one wall extend around feet lift shaky squeak go noise squeak transmit along ducting room point wake us often,0

There were only 2 female staff by the check in desk but there were 2 male staff just watching, standing by the concierge desk. None of them offered to help the other 2 female colleagues to help with checking in guests.
That incident was the thing which most distressed me about the hotel. Although the hotel is not culpable for guest behaviour, the hotel lacked good managerial skills to organise enough staff or a dedicated desk to large groups checking in. There was also no hotel security in sight to move the old man shouting insults at me away from the lobby are.
Male bar staff were also extremely rude in their manner of serving and the bar stunk. Seats by the windows were mended with tape - which is bizarre, given that the hotel could easily get a free sofa on Olio or Freecycle.
The single bed was way too narrow for a pregnant woman and I could not sleep.
There is only one small lift for the entire hotel, which is for guests and staff. So bear this in mind if you have to rush for appointments/flights/trains, etc.
The hotel employs mainly foreign staff and by nature, foreign people living in the UK will be less assertive and avoid conflict. The main fault seems to be with management with regards to the significant difference on professionalism by female versus male hotel staff. I observed female staff constantly at work and I observed male staff constantly killing time or being unprofessional.",male hotel staff whilst queue check male portuguese men start cut queue lot people wait check tell rude cut queue old portuguese man shout across lobby group men misogynistic comment follow loud laugh male group check desk fluent portuguese raise voice english tell not speak like women none hotel staff intervene move men reprimand behaviour female staff check desk male staff watch stand concierge desk none offer help female colleagues help check guests incident thing distress hotel although hotel not culpable guest behaviour hotel lack good managerial skills organise enough staff dedicate desk large group check also hotel security sight move old man shout insult away lobby male bar staff also extremely rude manner serve bar stink seat windows mend tape bizarre give hotel could easily get free sofa olio freecycle single bed way narrow pregnant woman could not sleep one small lift entire hotel guests staff bear mind rush appointmentsflightstrains etc hotel employ mainly foreign staff nature foreign people live uk less assertive avoid conflict main fault seem management regard significant difference professionalism female versus male hotel staff observe female staff constantly work observe male staff constantly kill time unprofessional,0

3- the rooms were dirty full of dust and had a very bad odour , the carpets were in very poor condition and full of dust 
4- I booked a room with a view instead they gave me a room far away from a nice view and very close to ongoing maintenance , that i have to sleep in very noisy environment the whole day 
5- I suffered a lot getting a nap surrounded by mice , dust and noise 
6- I aslo booked a room with double large bed instead they gave me a small room with two small separate bed to sleep !!!
7-there were no available room service or even reception service all the team to call for help or assistance 
8-the TV screen was not working properly as the remote control was not working and not matching the TV brand !!! 
9-there were very few drinks left in the room to use 
10- there were very little samples of soap and shampoo left in the bathroom obviously it was really annoying to find a very small piece of soap or very Ting bottle of shampoo to use 
11- I found a label in my room by the hotel staff asking their guests not to leave their valuables at the rooms , I really felt unsafe to leave my watch in the room or my luggage or laptop

11108,"Do not get the breakfast! The wifi isn't free! The staff was all young and seemed to not want to be there. There was a lot of construction in the area when we were there, so it was loud, and at night, we couldn't walk directly from the train station to the hotel because the sidewalks were closed. I'm sure that's why we got a good deal on the price. 
Because it cost less, the clientele was a mixed bag, as a woman, I wouldn't have wanted to stay by myself. Back to the breakfast - it is a buffet style of motel style food in a dusty old ballroom. Not my vibe. Don't get talked into buying the breakfast vouchers when you check it. If you value quality food at all, it's worth it to walk around the corner to one of the restaurants for breakfast. 
Also, when I checked in, I was told the wifi in the lobby was free, but in the rooms, we only got 40 minutes a day. That was not explained ahead of time. As an American with my own business, I have to be able to check in, and I booked hotels with wifi so that I could work in the mornings. I found out, after going up to the room that you only get 20 minutes every 24 hours and then it cuts you off and asks you to pay.

As we wondered around the labyrinth that is the Britannia International Hotel (Canary Warf) with rather poor directions, I came across water damage and a hole in the ceiling right by our room. I went to find my wife (still wondering around trying to find our room) as I walked back towards our room I heard scurrying in the ceiling, I looked up at the gaping hole caused by the water damage only to see two mice, one of which fell out onto the floor and ran into room 167 (there is a CCTV camera that will show you the incident). Our room was substandard and after complaining (and mentioning the mice) we were offered an upgrade. When being upgraded and moved from our room the concierge seemed unfazed, although apologetic and helpful, by the fact there are mice in a hotel (which has a restaurant downstairs, I'm sure this is a health and safety issue?). In the suite we were upgraded to there was a lovely little humane mouse trap under our bed (clearly an ongoing issue with mice) the bed was comfortable enough (on tiny wheels and seeming to be two bases pushed together to make one bed), the pillows were ok at best. The rooms and hotel as a whole need small upgrades wherever you look (wallpaper, burnt furniture needs to be removed or refurbished, tiny TV's in a large room, that kind of thing). When we decided to head out to eat (obviously no chance we were eating a thing in the hotel) there were trays of used crockery, glasses, wine bottles and a bin left out in the open on the floor (another possible health and safety issue here?).

11239,"One of the worst hotel experiences ever. I reserved based on the decent reviews on Bookings, and it was awful. The staff at the desk could not speak English, they would request you sign papers and yet have no idea what they are handing to you. So resolving anything was a headache and at least an hour wait, as other guests were complaining about the hotel.
The wi-fi, is not free in the rooms, unless you are down in the lobby. Which looks like a fraternity full of high school kids, absolutely no class for a lobby, as everyone is in pjs in the lobby making use of free wi-fi, and quite uncomfortable and noisy. The paid wi-fi also goes on and off in the room, and it is 7¬£ pounds per device. It is terrible wi-fi even paying it, and the staff doesn't really care when mentioning it. The hotel makes money on extras, wi-fi, parking, even you leave a few minutes late, anything... they will charge. It isn't clear until you get into the lobby and see their signs here and there with extra costs for all types of things. So if you think you are saving on a lower cost room, you really aren't.
In addition to the horrible staff service, the bed mattress had every spring in it hit your back and crack as you move to try to find a position on it. I had reported that the mattress was not at all in sleeping condition, their reply, "" they're quite new mattresses, "" and i asked the supervisor to please check mattress to see for himself. Not a little dent, the whole thing was shot!
First day I arrived late from flight, went to buy two club sandwiches for me and my friend at the hotel restaurant. I paid 28¬£ pounds, hoping they'd be decent sandwiches. The chicken was so dry and old. The bread was awful. My friend didn't even eat it. So we ended up a night with barely anything to eat, and from there on in, went outside of the hotel to eat.

The tiny tablets of soap - if you want to wash yourself bring your own standard soap. Plus the shampoo they supply is useless. They also don‚Äôt leave a face washer in the room, which makes it hard to use the body wash they supply. 
There is no fridge in the room so you can‚Äôt keep a drink or anything else cold in your room.

- it was a single bed room instead of a double standard, as said and per my booking
- it smelled strongly of fresh paint and chemicals
- the carpet was partially dirty with some white powder, probably from the renovations
- the shower was defective, probably from installation

Do not book this hotel. The entire place is filthy. The rooms stink of stale cigarettes. The bounce beds are tiny and have a single duvet thrown over them that only just covers the exact size of the bed when laid flat. The electrical appliances have undated test certificates - if any at all. Ironing board covered in black streaks and unusable. The iron was stained black too. Carpets filthy. Big Queues at check in due to every single person ahead of me complaining about hidden extras, obscure rules, foul smells, poor food, invalid vouchers. The ‚Äòwould you like upgrade to a room with a window‚Äô gag was tried on everyone that checked in for the 20 minutes my process took. Some said yes and were charged extra. Those who said no were then ‚Äòupgraded as our gift to you‚Äô. It‚Äôs all a con. There probably aren‚Äôt any rooms with no window. Read the Ts and Cs and be aware before you book - they are obscure and used to trap you. There is a reason why a 4 star hotel has a no cancellation policy - it‚Äôs because everyone tries to cancel when they see what they booked. When a supposed 4 star hotel is available on the heart of Canary Wharf for an unbelievably low price, and all around are at least double the price, it should ring alarm bells.

No free WiFi, only an expensive option giving you 24 hours access on one device only, which in this day and age is ridiculous. Annoying details like soaps being changed every day, so you need to unpack a new hand soap, which is both impractical and a complete waste.
Crowd is more of a 2 stars hotel clientele, so you'll find empty glasses and old cigarettes and joints right outside the hotel, bar won't allow you to charge drinks on your room because ""if we give you free credit you might not be able to pay"". That says it all.
Lots of construction outside making it difficult to access from the tube. Dirty entrance (metal doors that are never polished so look filthy).

so now - No WIFI and no TV.
Great.
3. Plug sockets near bed - I don't understand why hotels do this - it's the end of the day and you want to check your phone but have no power - so now have to stand up near the plug socket in order to do it.

Being not very big myself only just under 6 foot and my wife over 5 foot found this strange to start with and would recommend strongly to have two single beds requested, not the midget bed we got and also request additional blankets.
Also the calming part of a bedroom is the relaxing colours chosen, however this has not been been passed onto the owners as the dated decor, an old warn bathroom that need plumbing issues rectified, (took nearly five minutes for the sink to drain) helped give an almost Basle Faulty appearance (hotel lift screen broken, glass and Champagne bottles left on our floor near lifts for nearly 15 hours). The breakfast served was poor, as I do not like the fact that when the bacon is selected and lifted up, it stuck to about nine other pieces along with a sausage that tasted strange at best.
I know that we did not pay a premium for the hotel and ordered one with a view which we received. But for value for money you can do a lot better as London is not short of accommodation which I believe will offer a good nights sleep.

12779,"I was staying for 3 nights to meet with friends to see the Chic and Il Divo concerts at the RN College in Greenwich, a couple of tube stops away on the DLR.
After being given room 211 on the 2nd floor with no working AC (just a brass switch on the wall!), a filthy carpet & old shabby threadbare chair, the surly, non verbal duty manager moved me along the corridor to 215 which at least had the appearance of a newer a.c. control panel. This wasted 20 mins after a long journey & the hotel's attitude just irritated me more. The replacement room was also in a very poor condition. I was made to feel that I was just being a nuisance & I felt too intimidated to complain further. To have lost another half hour and wait for the unsmiling, unsympathetic duty manager again was, for me, an option I didn't wish to repeat.
The carpet stank & was badly stained & dirty - and I mean Seriously Stained. The only place it was fit for was a skip...its so bad that I wouldn't have it outside my garage let alone inside. I never went barefoot in the room at all.
The room had old & broken furniture; filthy, damaged walls with, not just marks, but chunks taken out of them; the control for the AC/heating didn't do the job although it sounded as if it worked; the large window was damaged which meant that it could not be altered from its wide open position & the constant traffic noise volume kept me awake.
The 2 lifts at the the far end took forever & when I nipped up the stairs exit, I was really shocked to see 2' strips of black gaffer tape across MOST of the treads' edges - which were keeping the thread bare carpet together (& presumably acting as a makeshift tripping hazard avoidance measure!)
